# Brigade Organizer's Playbook Extension Project

### Overview
The Brigade Organizer‚Äôs Playbook (BOP) Extension Project is an initiative of the Code for America National Advisory Council (NAC). 

The BOP Extension Project seeks to build on the existing product and improve its value as a communal, high-value resource for sharing best practices in topic areas such as fundraising, recruiting members, running remote brigades, project management, setting and achieving DEI goals, etc.

üåê This project is 100% open source, transparent and community led
- Our work flow is available online at our [GitHub Project Broad](https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade-playbook/projects/1) 
- As we do our research we will be adding the P&P assets to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N0VSDhYyy5WhX_z18Q0RvLlGO29JGGdMxVsD4X3nFYs/edit?usp=sharing)

**Project context**
Each of the 80+ Code for America Brigades generates valuable learnings in topic areas such as fundraising, recruiting members, running remote brigades, project management, setting and achieving DEI goals. What worked and how to replicate some of these are documented in the current Brigade Organizer‚Äôs Playbook.

Both the NAC and CfA independently identified the need to have replicable templates of processes and practices as part of their strategic priorities for 2020, to help scale the impact of Brigades' work to transform Civic life through technology.

**The initial Scope of Work (SOW)** 
Exploratory interviews with Brigade Organizers - to discover what best practices and processes exist, as well as report on what future needs would improve the ongoing collection and sharing of learnings across the network.

For more information the initial SOW and its milestones, refer to: [Brigade Organizer's Playbook One Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7HmROzkFYVyu7cFkzirwgO-F4i8v6ijQQ4PF44f5bE/)
