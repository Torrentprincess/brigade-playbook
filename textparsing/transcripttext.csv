it doesn't, i'm not here yet.

unknown speaker  0:46  
i thought you were gonna watch amazon stuff.

 0:49  
oh, sorry, i can do that in a little bit. dummy

unknown speaker  1:02  
dummy monsters really monsters. so christie up on the next row personally think on facebook, on the winston page about the bradford pears, that they actually have little pears. at the end, and like this time of year, that you can make jelly out of

unknown speaker  1:30  
acid

unknown speaker  1:32  
under me that i've never noticed that about him. she was like really you never know. well, i also don't have any in my heart. so that makes a difference, too. think it would be neat to have the, like, the light behind the tv. but if we did that. i know we have the counter thing. but i think i would rather mail it and have the lights around it like that. i think it would be called like like it's hovering funky.

unknown speaker  2:37  
right. right. because you return icicle lights and that's what i was getting worried.

 2:55  
no, no icicle lights. don't know why this isn't how do i fix it.

unknown speaker  4:17  
hello.

unknown speaker  4:35  
majan you.

unknown speaker  4:39  
there we go.

 4:47  
i can hear you just fine. okay.

 5:09  
i am doing as well as can be expected, it's a saturday, but it's kinda chilly here. okay.

 6:06  
is it oh no that's fine you can record it's much easier and i don't have a problem, so.

unknown speaker  6:11  
okay, thank you.

 6:13  
because you can put it through a transcription thing and it's much easier when you do yeah. great. okay.

 7:27  
yes.

unknown speaker  7:31  
and one more thing.

 7:43  
that is correct.

 8:00  
i've got it sitting right there now should be fine. yeah.

unknown speaker  8:06  
um,

 8:39  
okay, i've got them. okay.

"," 9:08  
we don't actually run hacknight this brigade we act as a collaboration of the seven brigades in north carolina so i'm. let me see. i guess i'm gonna have to go with zero. okay. okay. that way you wanted it done.

 9:48  
so each of the individual brigades have their own meetings. okay, we just organize. if there's a project of statewide interest that type of thing. so,

 10:04  
i want to say seven six or seven depending on if they're active or not.

"," 10:20  
um, we did not participate as a collaborative, so i'm. i'm gonna say, that would be six, since we didn't really have any other example of how we could do that as a, as a state. okay.

"," 10:55  
give this fairly well. for instance, at least four of the five, or at least for the brigades actually have members who are either government employees or have a very good relationship so i think we do that pretty well.

"," 11:36  
can you be, again, i think we do that pretty well. it's again it's a little uneven depending on the brigade that you're talking about individual brigades but we give a little more on one on one i want to say a little more structure to the way the individual brigades interact with their community partners and their government partners so yes. okay.

"," 12:15  
we do that once we did that once we used to do it twice a year we do it once a year now. we were we will do sort of a urine review the kind of thing that the brigade network is doing right now but we actually do it too so you know how well did you do this how well did you do that and do some assistance, i think we do that pretty well. okay.

"," 12:48  
i would say, again we do that fairly well. um, the again we have several people within the different brigades that know those have those skills so for instance, we have some people in the rally brigade who do that we have some people in asheville, and they will lend their expertise to the other brigades when they don't have it so i think it's actually helps us with that type of that type of process because we do have the ability to share resources across cities so you know that's that's part of, that's what we do. okay, the resources.

"," 13:36  
see, we, we don't do it. we i wish we did it better than we did we had a couple of people who were. so i'm not sure, not having example. i mean i wish we wish we would do it better so i don't see that on your list of options. okay. i'd say we do it but not well, so that's that's

unknown speaker  14:20  
okay.

"," 14:52  
the time. we will each individual brigade has their own level at which they administered the code of conduct, we will act as an impartial third party sometimes, when there are two when there are two individuals or two different positions within the brigade we can come in and offer them a third impartial so i think we do that pretty well. i'm going to go with the one there.

unknown speaker  15:27  
okay.

"," 15:38  
our core team is the is the leaders of all the individual brigades. i think we're, we're doing, we used to do that very well we're done it, we're not doing it as well. lately, there's a couple of brigades that have kind of gone silent. okay, so i'm gonna say, i don't know, based on the way we answer the other question. i wish we did it better as i wish we had so.

unknown speaker  16:05  
okay,

"," 16:28  
we do very well in drafting it we have very hard time following through. oh, yes, we have, so i would say yes, very good, on how we draft it. so, if that was the limit of the question.

unknown speaker  16:43  
yeah. okay,

"," 16:58  
again we have done that in the past we do it very well fairly well. okay, no one. okay.

"," 17:13  
we will offer assistance to the different brigades on how to do fundraising. but the individual brigades have their own their own success in doing so, but we again offer assistance and guidance and i think we do it pretty well, i would say,

unknown speaker  17:37  
okay.

 17:38  
so one again. okay.

"," 17:51  
so we use google groups we use slack, we have our own slack board with lots of channels. github issues. old fashioned mailing lists. you know, we tried it, we, we try to get to the, we try to reach people wherever they are. we don't try to force them into any one particular way of communications we know different groups have different preferences. from populations as well. okay.

unknown speaker  18:27  
so i took that as a one.

unknown speaker  18:28  
yes.

"," 18:36  
that we do very badly.

unknown speaker  18:39  
oh, okay. so

 18:40  
i'm gonna say six. because, i would say, we had a very clear vision, a couple of years ago when we went through this whole process. i think right now that hasn't been a really good. handoff from leader to leader year to year type of thing and i don't know that how well the individual brigades know what the, what resources available to them on a statewide basis so we haven't done a really good job doing that, keeping that up. okay.

"," 19:25  
again, with the all the individual brigades directly onboard with the national network. it really doesn't apply to us so i'd say zero don't know. okay. okay.

"," 19:58  
we actually a few years ago had someone who spent quite a bit of time developing that. js inhibits was on the neck was one of the first people on the neck. then he developed a framework, which is the framework we still use. so i'd say we do that fairly well so again one. okay.

"," 20:33  
i think we, we do that we do that well, since we are located in several different cities we don't have in person meetings like that for once a year and that's generally only the leaders of the brigades. so that's how we operate so we do it pretty well one. okay.

"," 21:03  
we do that fairly well again well since we're talking about the individual brigades all have their own direct policies we only really offer advice and oversight. so, but i think we do that well. okay,

"," 21:30  
oh, we have not really done a really great job, that the people who come in from government usually already have a position. they don't, we don't necessarily bring people from the civic tech into the government space. so if we don't do that well.

unknown speaker  21:53  
so,

 21:56  
six,

"," 22:14  
we do have a good, a fairly good network. i think we do that pretty well i'd say one. the fact that we are such a, we have such a broad area that we do cover, and we have a lot of different resources that i can send, i can send out a request and get people from all over the state who may be interested in a position. okay, you do that pretty well. okay.

"," 23:03  
no, i think we just, i think it just almost a matter of each individual brigade is a little different so i think there's always going to be those things that we don't all. not every single topic is going to apply equally to every single brigade even a quasi brigade kind of like we are. so i think that's always going to be a challenge. okay.

"," 24:04  
i'd say yes. okay.

 24:25  
i would say the most is going to be the intro or inter brigade resources. so it's basically being able to leverage resources from all the different brigades mm exhausting their talents and abilities. so for instance, the one of the big projects we're doing now is a finance dashboard. and people from raleigh from durham from chapel hill from greensboro, four different brigades actually all collaborating, through the slack through all the different online means on the project for, you know, it's campaign finance for the state so we're looking at, you know, state level, constantly state races, local municipal races, things like that. so, and i think, you know, just the fact that we're able to draw upon those multiple gauges is really helpful. i think that's something that even if you don't have a quasi brigade sitting above a state you can actually have different brigades reach out to brigades that are nearby that might have the same interest in sharing development of a project. that's

unknown speaker  26:07  
okay. um,

unknown speaker  26:14  
okay one minute. okay.

 26:37  
um, we actually have a at least an outline, i don't know if it's necessarily a fully fleshed out document. and then will the people who are responsible for onboarding new participants know all of the steps to follow so you know there's. if you're interested, make the ask at the meeting send them the link, send them you know get an email, they know the the five or six steps that we want to do to get it to bring a person on for the project will generally do, you know, we also do this project, especially we have had the project leader or the ux people actually do follow ups individually with the people to gauge their interest, their skill levels whether they want to work, you know front end back end design. be a liaison type of things so. okay.

 27:53  
i mean, it's, it's, i mean it's like a one pager and that's about it. so it's not a full.

unknown speaker  27:58  
okay. yeah.

 28:04  
there's room for interpretation and use by the person actually doing it. okay. yeah.

 28:49  
i would say number two. okay.

 29:12  
i don't think we really want to make it any more detailed. the reason i feel that is we, like i said, we want to give the person who is actually doing the work the freedom to interpret the situation and apply it appropriately so we say, here's what you do when someone expresses an interest they come to a meeting, get these three pieces of information get them to sign into these three accounts, do a follow up meeting but we don't really tell them anything more on how to do any of that. i don't, i think if we made it too detailed, you would feel less inclined to adapt it to the specific situation. so i think i'd like it being a more of a skeleton living document and clickable to the situation so.

unknown speaker  30:15  
okay.

 30:34  
i would have to go look it up. i do not have it myself. i know it's in our google docs, but i don't have the link at the top of my fingers. okay, if you want to either send me some follow up i can, i can definitely get that to you. okay. okay.

 31:22  
no, i think pretty much everything we do after that is pretty standard. the way. open source brigade projects work i don't think anything we do is that much different. okay.

 32:04  
i am for the open nc brigade, i'm kind of the gatekeeper and the custodian of the relationships between the different brigades within the state. i act as the main go between our cooperation brigade, and the national network but the seven brigades that sit underneath the open nc all directly, talk to the national network as well. okay, so.

 33:10  
again we don't, we don't have members per se, everyone. i mean if i was to say within all of north carolina, there would be over 100 but everyone is a member of our brigade and also a member of their local brigades so it's either. you can even look at it as all the people in north carolina or just myself, depending on how you want to address it. how you how you frame the picture.

 33:51  
there's 100 people that can use our resources and work on projects. yes. okay.

unknown speaker  33:57  
that's perfect.

 34:07  
oh, well we let's see if as a brigade we've been three years, i've been doing it since then. okay, prior to that we informally met without any sort of a charter for the three years before that so a total of six years. okay.

 34:38  
the cuse me,

unknown speaker  34:40  
the bop, the book.

 34:43  
i've not seen did not know anything about it until you contacted me.

unknown speaker  34:47  
okay.

 35:13  
i definitely think anything we can do to get more information and more feedback from the people that were doing the work then definitely yes,

 35:34  
there are there are a couple of people. jason habits would be one that i would, but i also has hesitated, because i haven't asked them if they'd be interested in participating.

 35:50  
okay, i would, i would say. jason habits, would be one that would have a lot of good insight and jeremy borden who is leading up our current project. the campaign finance dashboard. excuse me. the campaign finance dashboard would also have some useful insights, i think, and how it works. he's also very, very new at leadership in brigade so we definitely would have a different perspective.

 36:23  
i can get them for you. i know jason. speaking with jason habits, as part of because he's also our lead for the rally brigade. okay have him on your list.

 37:56  
no, i think you i think you pretty much covered it, you listen to me. go on about how i think being less structured is better because each individual brigades needs are different than the other brigades and the people who are actually actively engaged in it need to have the freedom to explore those differences within their own processes on the ground. good.

 38:33  
i have no problems with anyone getting any of my answers.

 38:40  
fully probe fully public yes, sorry. okay. yeah, i mean, i do this as well and i realize you have to get the exact answers.

 39:06  
okay, thank you, you have a good day as well.

",chris (open nc collaborative),,014_opennccollaborative_2020-11-21_Chris-Mathews.txt
0," 16:31  
how you doing today i'm

 16:37  
it's friday it's friday sums out

 16:48  
do the trick. yeah, yeah,

 20:07  
okay, i'm gonna copy this in. yeah, paste it in another window in case the chat gets long. yeah. yeah.

unknown speaker  20:34  
all right. okay.

",," 21:48  
yeah. should i just verbally answer them. would that be more

 22:04  
yeah, so i would say for this one,

we have, we have less experience during the days of action, which is somewhat ironic cuz like that was like sort of the first thing we did that certainly brigade, we sort of like lost track of it in between. um, i will say this past round with when we've had to do it remote. having that that kind of central event that then kind of things branched off of took a lot of the weight of that off of us, because it was like, i yeah, we had to have like a partner available to do an activity. when like i didn't have to worry about all the logistics of that first part. okay. yeah, or like, or like what we're supposed to be doing for that first part. also i kind of felt like it connected folks to national that in our group that otherwise like they don't, it's not it's not there at hack night right like they don't see any, they don't see like somebody like amanda or somebody like or other folks on cfa staff so, yeah. okay,

"," 23:20  
so this is, i think, been a been a bit of a weakness for us. we've had a couple of like almost mm with like the chicago city chicago has a design office. mm hmm. and there's a person there that that we know we've tried a couple of times to start something, but i suspect that like figuring out how to manage maintain that relationship and kind of get it to something actionable is something that we could use plenty of learning on. frankly, i'm not super sure like what that looks like as a presentation to us but that's probably something that we could use help with because, as most of our partnerships right now as a result or with nonprofits. i was kind of figured out ways to manage that effectively but that next step of like, alright now like let's partner with the city for something, is we're not quite there yet. okay.

unknown speaker  24:16  
um,

"," 24:29  
so, so that one i think we do really well. okay, we have a pretty decent process where, like, once we can identify like once we've identified a partner that has indeed, or what we do is we treat it a bit like kind of similar like maybe how like a law firm might treat a pro bono work, like we put together a team and treat it like a consulting engagement. so we'll have like someone who's like the liaison is like a project manager. they'll scope out the project and try to recruit people based on skills and the idea is to try to then have that, like a solid core group that runs that project all the way through. and that we've managed to deliver a few a few like things to completion, like where we actually delivered something for the client that way so far, which honestly like a lot of that is stuff that i've kind of borrowed from. i work at it for profit consultancy for my day job so it's kind of been borrowing firings processes from what i've seen work there. okay.

"," 25:46  
an example there might be helpful. i can't say that we've done that one before we've done like one on one engagements with with our like nonprofit clients we haven't done like a workshop where something works like that. so be kind of cool

"," 26:20  
so that one might be useful to see how others do that. i don't think we're in a, in a situation where we've had problems. but there's probably room for, i mean there's always room for improvement. so i'd be curious to see especially like with volunteers, being like your source of like folks that are doing the things that probably impacts the way you do agile and lean things right.

unknown speaker  26:43  
yeah. okay.

"," 27:03  
so this one i think this is something we're going to be doing probably a bit more. pretty soon. we have engagement with the chicago or the greater chicago food depository where they want to build this kind of like mapping application out. so let's consider a more complicated than other stuff we built, it's kind of like, oh, here's the basic wordpress site or, you know, things like most of our projects or things like that or here's an off the shelf thing. mm hmm. which is great like that is fast and you but usually doesn't require a lot of user testing on our part, since we didn't make it right. um, but in this case we probably will want to be doing that more with them. since we're kind of putting something together. that's a little bit more custom. we are using some cfa provided tools like really use carto or matte box, but they're still in it. anyway, there's an element where that would be helpful for sure.

"," 28:23  
example could could be useful there. i think it's a solid three. we haven't we haven't had many incidences of this i think we've only had one, the whole time. mm hmm. and we didn't really have a process, it was just sort of like, i spoke to the person privately and like hey that's not the kind of behavior that we find acceptable here and it was it, and then they just sort of didn't come back after that, which, which is fine, i guess because if yeah, if they don't want to abide by the code of conduct then. then i really probably don't want them there. but i outside of that experience we haven't had a lot of use for practicing it and i imagine that having ryan just talked to the person every time it's maybe not scalable. so, having an idea of something that maybe is more scalable would would make would make sense, especially if the group starts to get larger.

unknown speaker  29:16  
yeah.

"," 29:26  
core team, um,

i say this i think we're doing a pretty decent job on the way we kind of warm folks up to that is by having them take on essentially project leadership positions or like being on part of those core teams. and that seems to be working pretty well. there's also folks that have. we also try to find respects that maybe don't want to do that but have other interests, whether it's like communication something like that they can help us with other things like our social media presence if that's their superpower. yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of effort i think right now is spent on like matching folks to that, that thing. right, yeah.

"," 30:31  
an example of what one of those looks like would be super, super useful. right now we don't have like something very formal written down, other than like hey we want to serve nonprofits, as if we're a consultancy shop, and we like we understand our why but having like written down like, okay, like, how are we going to do that over the long haul. so that that would be that would be a cool thing, if there was, if there was a resource that i talked about that. yeah.

"," 31:15  
i think that would also be useful in the past we've kind of the closest we've probably come to doing that is like drafting an mo, you know, with the partner, and that helps give some structure, but is perhaps not as detailed as going to a strategic plan would be. mm hmm. so again like seeing what one of those looks like. like, especially from another, another project or something would be, i think it'd be useful.

"," 31:58  
um, so fundraising is, is a weak spot i think for, for us, um, we've, we've done a little bit of it, some of it more of like if the inkind variety actually had finally gotten a sponsor to agree, but then the pandemic happened. and the thing they were gonna donate to us was space and food. so that didn't turn out to be all that useful anymore.

but since then, we haven't like really

ever like really gone to the point of trying to like do cash asks. mm hmm. i think also, in part because i don't know that i would know what i would do if i had a bunch of money. okay, maybe that's like part of me that's part of fundraising like like what are you fundraising for i yeah yeah i guess like there's like we have some ideas like being able to do things like have gift cards for user testing is like one one thing that it would be cool to have money for.

unknown speaker  32:56  
yeah, right.

"," 33:21  
i think we do reasonably well here, um, we're on slack we use meet up for the meeting management website to fold up both of those places. mm hmm. um, thing we're, i think the thing we're starting out right now is like, like project management tool ever gonna standardize on. uh huh. which i think we were looking at pivotal for that because it has a free, free tier if your project is public on there. okay, which all our projects are open source anyway so. hmm, that would kind of work out. yeah. yeah.

"," 34:10  
so, that one i think it would be good to have an example of there's a couple of folks that have started to work on that a little bit with us. no we don't. we don't have like

a plan for our brand, other than

you know we have a logo and stuff. and we have like a presence right but to say that we have like a coherent message would be a stretch i think

"," 34:51  
honestly, so when you said that my brain was like oh god what does that, what does that actually.

unknown speaker  34:56  
okay.

 34:57  
i don't think we've ever. i don't think that's like an activity we've really done it maybe that goes back to like something i said earlier about like we're folks, it was like the honestly for our brigade that brigade. both brigade congress and that national days of attacking for a lot of folks for the first time they interacted with national on that. okay, so we don't really have like a great way to bridge that the whole like yeah we're here in chicago, but also there's this. like this bigger thing that we're a part of. i mean we explain it, but that's not, i feel like there's probably something missing from that that we're probably not doing so if there was an example of like a way to do that successfully i would i would love, i would love to see that, because that's definitely like a big area for improvement for us. okay.

"," 36:01  
ah, so i think that would be useful. we haven't had a project that was like designed to be reused like that, but i imagine some at some point in the future that will come up. mm hmm. so being able to see something that gives an example of, of how one goes about doing that in a way that's effective would be good. yeah, because i imagine there's there's things that help out with that, like, like, like, what's the best license to use for repair if you're gonna do that, you know, is it mit, something like that or is there something else is preferential. i'm sure there's there's many other questions related to that sort of thing. so yeah that'd be good. mm hmm.

"," 36:52  
so, this one i actually think is something we do pretty well. um, we've actually not really had a drop off in involvement. as a result, um, in fact i've actually kind of had an easier time keeping folks engaged in the with the remote situation, in part because chicago is so big. geographically, no matter where i choose to have project night. it's gonna be a complete pain for somebody to get there, or some group of people out there, because it's yeah cuz it's, you know, having the center in the loop. it's going to be a half hour thing, minimum for a lot of people. right. it's not longer, like if someone's like, way down on the south side it might take them an hour to get to the loop. mm hmm. and then also, like always having in the loop has this sort of appearance of. it kind of in itself is like limits your audience because like you to loop events tend to get folks that are like, oh, i work in tech, in the loop. so like, you get an audience that perhaps looks a little too much like me, and not like others if you follow me, which isn't great like you know your your brigade you want it to look more like the whole country. so, yeah, so i found, as i've been on remote that i've had an easier time, not having that happen in the past. i'd also had events like in some neighborhoods. but those usually like we might get a different group of people but then it's hard to like get a lot of people. so it's kind of, huh. yeah, and a lot of the tools we use kind of work well for remote teams like slack is great for that. zoom works out well you know github works well for that. and some of the folks on our other folks in our core team kind of have experience doing remote work for the day job, like myself as well. so like trying to like this, even to the point of like facilitating like a brigade meeting. i use a lot of things from facilitating meetings at my day job like pull those things in and use them. i was actually funny enough give gave a talk at brigade congress about facilitating distributed meetings but, yeah.

 39:20  
i'm sorry. could you repeat the question one more time.

"," 39:33  
so that one,

that one, that one we could definitely use examples on. so, we don't have like a, an explicit effort, like or plan for that like i'm not for example tracking

involvement in a way that oh i'm sorry.

 40:05  
yeah. okay. yeah, so like, this isn't, we don't really have like a program on the brigade for this other than like when we have an event like, oh, like yeah let's like try to be mindful to not create barriers. mm hmm. but the other side of that like how do we reach folks that part is lacking i think for us. and i think it's important i don't, i personally don't have a lot of experience like i've never run in the dni program like i like we have about my work, and i, you know, witnessed it but that's like, that's a skill right to know how to do that well.

unknown speaker  40:43  
yeah, right. yeah.

"," 40:54  
local government job opportunities. um, so, so that'd be like, i, i'm not sure i'm not sure i follow the question.

 41:26  
oh, i see. and that ends up, leading to a job. yeah. okay. yeah, that one to that one that would be. that one's brought that one would be useful, is to have i think that goes hand in hand, which i think you're implying like the government partnerships question from earlier is that,

unknown speaker  41:43  
yeah.

 41:44  
yeah, i think, yeah, this year probably hand in hand, and we haven't we haven't really had a partnership with the, with the city. okay. yeah, so,

"," 42:11  
that can also be useful. we don't have like any formal programming, beyond. we kind of have like a core of folks that are more senior that will kind of act as informal mentors, as like folks are working on projects and things. and like myself all like, offered introduce people to others in my network if they, you know, if they ask or like those, those things are there we don't have like any formal programming. so seeing an example of what that might look like at the brigade level versus the, you know, individuals number gaid wanting to help out level would be kind of useful.

"," 43:04  
that's a good question. oh,

one that might be interesting doesn't become like a problem for us but it's something that we're going to increasingly have to think about in the future is like transitioning a project from like fish like it's short term form to it's like longer term form, whether it's like, this is a handoff to the community partner. i because i imagine there's a number of different models that exist out there in the network whether like summer gates maybe they they hold on to it and they maintain it forever. sometimes kids need to have some sort of handoff plan so that the organization that maintains the thing once it gets to done in quotes. yeah, and we haven't really made up our minds on that yet, like we have a project that we've kind of been doing the long term thing with but they're also still act like they're also, there's also still like work being actively done on it. so it's not. it's never hit done. mm hmm. maybe it just won't, but other there probably will be a project at some point that's like smaller in scope. and it'd be useful to have an idea of ways that i've been successful. really with either model. yeah.

 44:42  
oh sure, then you got that leaf blower going on.

"," 47:11  
all right. i think i probably for now, just have like have the one i think that's the front of my mind that i would

probably my share for the moment.

 47:24  
hi yeah how to title this. um, okay.

 48:52  
there's really not a lot. just. i think we have notes somewhere from where this meet when we were rebranding a long while back, okay well i guess like a little over a year, we kind of revisited like what's our why and decided to give this a go so it's probably like some notes from that conversation, but we haven't like written up. i'm methodology yet, which maybe that would be a, an action item to do at some point. yeah,

 50:00  
that's probably a two, like i've got, i've got some notes that i could take out but nothing that i would say is like ready to be packaged up in an handoff that would require a little a little extra effort. okay.

 50:35  
up pipes formatting and purity would both be helpful. i if i were to like write up something because it'd be it'd be great to get it is from like outside the core group. mm hmm. okay.

 51:04  
uh, i guess like that. i'd be happy to like, if they want to reach out to me i'd be happy to like, send more information, um, answer any specific questions that they might have, or if the interest is there, at that point, i can even try to put together

a document of some sort that would maybe be more appropriate for that. okay.

unknown speaker  51:34  
yeah, so

 51:51  
i'm the brigade captain

 52:05  
ah, so what do they intend active to mean.

 52:17  
okay. consistently show up i would say is around 1010 okay. and then there's there's that kind of outer circle that's kind of. who knows if they're gonna, huh.

unknown speaker  52:31  
yeah right,

 52:44  
i guess, are getting close to three years. yeah, it was 2017. yeah. okay. oh, i guess, is that question is intention like though, the whole group or anyone ever so like i've been a captain for the whole time but i've had a couple of co captains.

 53:16  
yeah. okay, so that would be two years, not three.

unknown speaker  53:19  
yeah. yes. okay.

 53:29  
i yes when we were, i believe when we were first getting set up that was sent along with the, with a bunch of with a bunch of other resources.

 54:02  
probably yearly, i would say, i think. yeah. okay. yeah, i haven't looked at it in a minute.

 54:32  
presser like three or four. it was really helpful when we got started. and it was really helpful again when we were doing like a rebranding. but we haven't we haven't had, i guess referred to it much beyond that, i guess if that makes sense. yeah, so it was like really helpful in spurts,

 55:15  
i guess i would guess that's an eight, like if someone if someone came to me and said like hey i'm starting up a new brigade, then that would be the thing i'd point them point them at like hey like you should read this.

 55:49  
oh yeah that'd be great. i, we don't we don't have a survey really of any sort, right now, so that would be awesome. okay.

 56:13  
potentially there's two other folks that are also, i can think of that are also very heavily involved in an organizing activities. mm hmm. as to whether or not they want to i guess is, i'm not sure but it'd be cool if they did, i guess, yeah.

 56:39  
yeah, so i just throw that in the chat real quick.

unknown speaker  56:42  
okay,

unknown speaker  56:43  
cool. let me

unknown speaker  57:02  
got one more. okay.

 57:59  
and nothing is coming to mind.

 58:20  
oh i fully public's fine. yeah.

 58:48  
thanks, you too. thank you so much for your time. bye.

0," 6:55  
okay sorry about sorry i couldn't hear you before.

 7:02  
yes, there is just, just half of feedback, i'm i am echoing on my end. can you hear me clearly there.

 7:16  
if you don't mind, i'm just gonna check my settings real. yeah, sure, sure. sorry i feel like you know we set up, but then there's always something. yeah.

 7:59  
okay. how about now. okay, i think. yes. can you good.

unknown speaker  8:06  
i can hear you. i'm

 8:11  
yeah, great. yeah, it's great now. okay.

 8:20  
good. i'm on hold. yeah. yeah.

unknown speaker  8:27  
how are you,

unknown speaker  8:28  
i'm doing well.

 10:39  
look. okay. oh, let me check in the chat. yeah. okay.

 11:30  
oh, i'm sorry, what was the question again.

 11:42  
okay. okay. sorry. okay, i understand now. yep. okay.

",," 12:36  
oh, sure. so. oh, sorry, sorry i've been actually like a co. captain or captain of my paygrade for some time now probably over five years, and we've done at this point. let's see, you know, probably 50 hack nights, honestly, wow, that's quite a bit when i look back on that because we need every three weeks. and so we've had and we've had an attendance from anywhere from zero to, probably, maybe 30 people. and so, i'm sure i am quite familiar, you know with the, with the overall format. and you know what usually happens at them. okay. but what i would, i guess, you know, one of the, you know, harder things. you know, for hack nights and some i think i've mentioned this in the past that i've always sort of tried to, you know, chew on that i realized a couple years ago, really was, how could. how can a new attendee like come to a meeting, you know be there for no more than you know two hours and then leave with the thought that they contributed to something new that they helped out, you know with like a project, and that's actually pretty difficult sometimes, you know, to do that because some of our projects, you know require a bit more of just onboarding and understanding, like exactly what the problem is and, maybe, a lot of times, you know, even, you know, they might may not even know the programming language that the particular project is in as well. so, or may not have it installed like on their laptop so they may even need to set you know that up as well. so you know there's been a couple. you know, smaller activities that we've done to sort of help. you know i guess mitigate that. and that would be things like sort of data collection or data cleanup. they're not always, those aren't necessarily always fun things to do, which would be things like taking information that was only available into a pdf and putting it like into a spreadsheet. like for campaign finance contributions like for local political officials, or placing information about like, local, local community gardens or something and then like putting that on a map based and seemed like if we only had like that, this garden is like located at like, you know, 37th and chatham or something, and then being able to put that like on a map so the sort of like a couple ideas, and we've had, you know, with i think somewhat mixed results, or like a very pop.

 16:42  
i'm sorry you broke up a little bit in the first part. so, if i understood you correctly. you're asking that i was looking for other things for you participants to do, or have so they could leave the meeting feeling like that they came away and contributed.

 17:26  
yes. yeah. okay. okay. and i know not like everyone is going to come to a meeting and feel like that they will want to just not be for them, you know. yeah.

 18:08  
i, i guess i would say zero. um, it, i don't feel like any one of the numbers really captures my experiences with them. oh man yeah at this point yeah i've probably organized. you know, you know, probably upwards of a dozen like national day of civic and, you know, events, or like coda crosses or things of that sort. and we don't do too too many of those activities. okay. but, you know, they have their time in place because usually it's not often very feasible to get something done in just over the course of an afternoon. but they're good at like, you know, just fostering community and bringing people together sort of like in one place. and so, i looking back on it i think we've had some successes of, of those because they're also since they're typically hold on weekends. sometimes we get a better audience or not a better audience, a lot of people who won't be able to come during the week. okay.

"," 19:41  
oh, oh yeah i said i guess it's three four and five. okay. for an example, it's something that we could do. we've done but we could do better. and, you know, and

for my time with and civic tech i feel like this. cultivating relationships with government partners is very different and it really depends on like your brigades capacity. like, i mean can you do just really have like members who are willing to go just back and forth and just, you know, sort of chat with government employees to sort of establish trust and also have really good understanding of. you know what's going on within you know their local government. and also, you'd also have to have, you know, like local government, buy in conceptually, you know with such an idea, and also you have to have like even like the technical capacity of, you know, the government as well, like if they want to implement sort of like any projects. and so we've. i think had some we've had some limited. our. so i think we started relatively low. you know, five or six years ago, and that there's just very little government cooperation just in general. okay. but now they at least have a little bit better recognition, sort of, of us, and we had a couple of internal champions, they've left. government and. and some of it too i think it's just a capacity issue right now have like me as like a captain to just like take time to like, maintain them as well which is also a little bit more difficult, like in the times of covid so because there's like, you know, no more. you know, there are meetings but not nearly as many meetings as there used to actually there's less meetings and there used to be, and less in person opportunities to catch up with them.

unknown speaker  22:40  
okay.

"," 22:54  
i think we do this relatively well, but other you know other brigades. you know may not. and it's something a little bit of just like yeah learning over time. okay. and one thing that is sort of maybe struggle or that are looked at learn more about with like building community partnerships is like sort of trying to set like, you know, actually i think i've done a good job of like of temporary expectations with community partners. but where they don't think oh hey we're gonna build everything you know for them i think they've got that a pretty good understanding of that. one thing that i would appreciate maybe a little bit more help is having them. also, getting yeah i guess maybe get involved in our brigade maybe a little bit as well, which i know it's kind of understand hard for them just because. and i know it's like a two way street to have like we have to go to their meetings as well, not just them come to our meetings so it's. i guess on both ends, we could do probably a little bit better with that it's just yeah that's just a lot of sort of work to do. but.

"," 25:21  
i would say actually five, um i think that's actually a really good and helpful concept for us to do something like that. um, i mean i think we've done it very informally like when they've attended our meetings, and like if we were in or if they had like an idea about something, i would like for a particular project i would sort of like talk them over to say hey you know have you done any like surveys with any of your like users your residents or clients, um, you know, what are your sort of expect, you know, expectations like if you want to do, like some sort of project. but having like a dedicated like workshop solely to identify like user needs. we haven't done that yet that's honestly that's just like a capacity issue of just like not having someone to say hey i was in our groups, saying hey i'll step up and run one of these.

unknown speaker  26:39  
okay.

"," 27:03  
actually we're kind of going we're kind of going through that right now. um, i would say probably three. okay, um, you know i have a little bit of experience in that, you know, professionally. you know like trying to create like minimal viable products of like in paring down like what the core features are. but i would appreciate you know but other you know having other examples would be, you know, sort of appreciated. okay.

"," 27:48  
i would also go with three. we've done a little bit of this and i've done a little bit of this. but despite us doing it, i still feel very. i feel like i still know that i don't know a lot about it.

unknown speaker  28:08  
okay.

 28:16  
yeah, i think that's a great way of of doing it i have seen that yeah, okay. and we started a cut group, or we didn't start a group of code group was started here which is like, you know, the civic user testing group. now we started here like earlier this year. and that provides a little bit of like a framework of conducting like user testing with with residence, which is really helpful and actually that's one i would probably share with the, with other brigades. okay. yeah.

"," 29:15  
i'm sorry. could you repeat that one more time. well,

 29:32  
so, i think, i guess, knock on wood. we've really been fortunate to have. i can only think of like as i said like 656 years of being sort of a brigade captain or co captain only been really one instance of like a code of conduct, you know violation, and it was not to say that they're all

you know all of them aren't. it was relatively a relatively minor one. and i think it was, you know, dealt with, you know like, effectively, but i don't you know there's always like the shorter form dramas like, oh, i don't know if like,

you know, we, we haven't had, like, a, you know, any code of conduct is only as good as, you know, enforced. and that is, and implemented. so i mean i'd like to think we, you know, you know i make it clear that, you know, i mentioned it at the beginning of, like every one of our hack nights and events, and i also, you know, post it like on our meetup page as well for every you know event. so i think, you know, short of those expectations are, you know, short of clear but you know you don't know if other people still uncomfortable. you know with snap, like, you know, with not common. you know, even if they see one there.

 31:39  
i would say yeah closer to three. yeah, cuz i mean example would be useful, because you have something like that happens, honestly. next week, i, i would have to yeah look into bob, you know. yeah, i have like you know obviously like sort of a gut, you know, of like how to handle it. but like, yeah, that's probably something i can also like use a refresher on. okay.

"," 32:12  
oh, um, that's something i've always struggled with, we're relatively smaller brigade. and, you know, we've had like several members. you know, who've been interested, you know, you know like who i like approached and said hey you know, would you like to take more of a role, you know, on, and they're like you know you do a great job i just, you know, they just don't want to make that commitment, you know, which, you know, it can really sometimes be, you know, a commitment. so i understand that they don't, you know, they don't want to make that commitment, they just, you know they just don't have the time. you know, just to step up more. and, you know, it'd be in volunteer based as well you know you can try to you know delegate tasks and i, you know, sort of have as well and, you know, with very mixed success. i always don't want to be like a pastor or sort of like a nag, either you to, you know, to people or, you know, to potential, you know, volunteers. you know, so that line is, you know, that's also a fine line and also that line varies greatly depending on the individual as well as some people do need a lot of hand holding and reminders and others don't. so, it. yeah, i would say yeah so probably five. yeah,

 34:07  
yeah it was smaller ones as well. right. and, you know, and i second guess sometimes like am i doing something wrong as well, like, right, because it's been always a struggle of like trying to get more, you know core people on and like you know we've had, you know, several members who are interested, you know, to continue being involved but they just yeah they just don't want to take that next step of. yeah. you know, becoming involved and, you know, they've already said it's just, yeah, i you know time commitments. yeah. and also i just don't want to feel like i'm sticking like so much work on them as well. yeah.

"," 34:57  
so we've done it in the past. um, we haven't done one in a couple years. honestly, mostly just because of capacity. and, you know, since we're all volunteer you know run and also you know sometimes priorities change as well.

and i guess one thing i struggle with with having a strategic plan is that, you know, if i you know sort of present one to like new members, and has like okay we're just gonna be like focus in on sort of like transit, or, like, you know, a couple strategic areas. they may not be interested in those, you know, sort of areas. so, yeah, they may not, you know, you know, they may not come back. you know, nonetheless, though i mean we still that's sort of our stronger areas so like, unfortunately, so like i know officially, you know, we still like focus on that. yeah.

"," 36:34  
um,

yeah, i would say three. i think the type of really, what kind of plan really depends on like on the project. and then what the goals are, whether it's like a policy one, or if it's, like, we want to build this piece of software one, or.

so you have regardless i think it depends on. and what the particular project is but i think getting nonetheless it would it would help. okay.

"," 37:41  
this one i think so it's been a little tough. um, i think for us. because i. so we have a couple partners that we sort of like collaborate with if we like do for like larger events. mm hmm. and they do a bit of the fundraising, you know there. but like fundraising like specifically for like our brigade. um, honestly you haven't really done, you know, much of it because we really don't have a budget. um, oh, and

unknown speaker  38:31  
i love that.

 38:31  
yeah, no, no problem. um, and, you know, and i'm like really familiar with the concept i guess i've never been sold of why i noticed i feel like it would take quite a bit of just time in like investment, investment of like time and energy to fundraise, and i don't know like if we're really there at or burgade, where that would be really helpful and necessary. like, i mean like our primary need i would feel like, oh, if we were to have fundraising. or like, you know, have you know, $500, i mean, what would it go to, i mean, i guess maybe pizza, at an event, and maybe childcare for an event. i mean i guess that that's not like those aren't you know bad things at all those like are definitely great for getting people in. but i feel like we just don't have enough of like capacity on the core team where it would with the limited time and energy that all of us have that it would be really helpful to do that. okay.

 40:18  
yeah. okay.

unknown speaker  40:23  
um,

"," 40:40  
let's see, i would see two, maybe you know i've been, as i said you've been around a while for it, and i feel like everyone has different everyone sort of has like different preferences as well, like what tools like sort of work for them and then you know some tools their features change also over time as well. and some people feel more comfortable than others with using certain tools. and, yeah, it's. i felt like yeah it's kind of a hard balance because you almost have to spread yourself across all these different tools because not one person. because not everyone, you're not going to get everyone under one. one tent. hmm, whether it's, yeah, facebook, meetup twitter, email, slack. yeah.

unknown speaker  41:45  
yeah.

unknown speaker  41:51  
okay.

"," 42:17  
i think we actually do do this without investing a whole whole lot time of doing it. i think we actually do this somewhat well, that we sort of become known as like a place for people to. yeah, work with like, you know, government data, and pain points that like, you know, government has sort of with technology and sort of like be like short like digital organizers, kind of in a sense. and i think a lot of it is honestly just been done through word of mouth and partnerships and people that we've had over the year, or, you know, from like meetings, and from like events that we've had, you know, over the years and other people telling others you know about what we do.

one thing i could think maybe that we could improve on is a lot of people who are new people who like sort of come to our meetings. you know they have, they actually have very little understanding of like how our local government like works. so we actually spend a little bit more time talking about that, rather than necessarily like what technology we would use to like sort of fix something, or just like pointing out other thing you know other organizations that are already doing something like this, you know. so maybe doing a little bit better of a job selling ourselves to like potential new attendees, but like, in terms of like community partners, i think we do a pretty good job actually of sort of selling a little bit of selling ourselves.

 44:21  
yeah. okay, one or two yeah. okay.

"," 44:40  
i think that's something i could have used like a little bit help as well. because, as someone who's been doing this for a while it's a little bit difficult to sometimes like sort of remove myself, have to say that this is also like a greater part or part like this is a part of like a greater movement, and that there's other you know people across the country that are doing this but at the same time like not overwhelming them new members and also not even thinking like that this is a cult or like some sort of like some sort of like over involved. you know thing as well i should try to position it as to say like, hey, it's like sort of like a, like minded folks of like minded groups like you know like us who are dealing you know sort of with the same issues sort of in their cities, you know, we, you know commiserate, you know, ensure best practices, you know with the, with each other and successes and failures. and you know strategies. i think for some newer members they may not see like the quote unquote like value proposition for, like, instantly joining you know the national network, they want to, you know, they're more interested on seeing like what could be done here locally.

or, and that's just my perception i think a little bit. and, you know, i've interviewed and, you know, sometimes too it's also you know you're requiring them to take like an extra, you know, time out of their hands to our time out of their day to like, you know, join a slack, or to like read what these other groups are doing or to, like, come to the local brigade congress that we have in cleveland. you know, which was like the national event last year. and, you know, i remember a couple feedback. feedback from a couple people that said, you know, this was great and they almost felt like it was just over, they were just almost like overwhelmed, just because

unknown speaker  47:05  
they.

 47:09  
there was just you know really all new for them, and understandably so you know this is not something you can just instantly pick up in a minute, or like in a 60 minute session. so, yeah, it's so and i think i would also say in summary for the folks listening to this, that you're providing like sort of the right value propositions or the right benefits for them to like wanting to join, like, what the brigade national network is about, besides just learning like those, you know best practices and like commiserate and things like that, or you know professional development opportunities as well. i find other ways that that could be like sold to them, i think, would be.

 48:33  
um, i know we've been talking a bit, a bit and i don't mean to run too long. how are we doing on time.

 48:54  
yeah we did for an hour. we can't go much over that.

unknown speaker  49:00  
yeah.

"," 49:31  
sir, with the scale again.

 49:42  
i would say actually two i think the network already does an okay job of of doing that sometimes like the details. i think ultimately you know when you want to find out like about replicating another brigade, or project with another brigade from another project from another brigade as unless it's a very very small project you know you're gonna have to directly reach out to the other brigade captain and just have a conversation. just to get, you know, a better understanding and lay of the land of like the context of how the project was made and. okay. and, and, like, best practices and such. i mean if it's some really small activity or, you know, project like scraping scraping can't campaign finance reports or something, then, yeah, that, that can be done in one or two night hack nights or something that could probably be done strictly through a read me like an occasional question being asked, you know, in the cfa slack, but anything larger than that, especially anything that would have any sort of government partnership, that would be something where, you know, you really want multiple conversations with the, with the other brigade captains. and also, you know, i come to learn to yeah you know you can't always replicate the projects across other from one city to another because, you know, the city may even have like different technology stacks, or they may have different capacity levels so you like you couldn't rely on this partner to pick up, like, you know, to be able to do the technology and like this entire workflow. because maybe in st. louis. yeah, they do, you know, x, they, they gather the data, and they added it and they also publish it, like within this government agency but over, and cleveland. this project is actually. those three steps are done by two different agencies, and they may not happen in the same order as well so you may not be able to exactly replicate like a project, per se. okay, yeah one place to another. so i would say

unknown speaker  52:19  
maybe.

 52:23  
yeah, i don't, i would say zero. but i think my feedback that i gave was pretty helpful there. okay. i hope so.

"," 53:03  
one through six. mm hmm. i'm in sort of the same scale

as three. um, yeah it's definitely been a little bit more challenging for multiple regions you know just everyone you know also being stressed more and also just yeah the uncertainty of life or like how we could best help. and also, like our numbers have been down a little bit. but i know we're also one of the smaller brigades as well. so i think that's where we're smaller numbers actually do really help where you know we have less than 10 people at a meeting. you know, they could follow one conversation at a time without feeling like, you know, they're completely ignored or like overlooked, you know.

"," 54:27  
actually six yeah, that's something that we could definitely use more systems on. okay.

"," 54:43  
i think one. i think we actually do this pretty well.

unknown speaker  54:47  
great. okay.

"," 55:05  
currently 02 we don't do that much of it. and, yeah, just, just to keep it. i would say do you don't over pressed for time yeah. okay.

unknown speaker  55:18  
um,

"," 55:38  
prep six succession planning. okay. yeah.

unknown speaker  56:05  
um, mr.

 56:13  
secession planning for like. so, for you know previous, or for like new members to take over like, okay, yeah.

"," 57:06  
yeah, there's a couple small things, which would be having a like meeting agenda template has been helpful. like you know in a google doc, um, you know, having a slack bot that automates people to join has been helpful. yeah, in terms of, you know, processes,

like hopeful. oh, um,

 57:53  
yeah those are two things that immediately come to my head. and, yeah,

 58:16  
its spreadsheet and. okay. yeah and i could send her like no spreadsheets like a template.

unknown speaker  58:23  
okay. yeah. um,

 59:19  
for because i think it's also not, it's now c three. okay.

 59:39  
i'm sorry. can you repeat that

 1:00:02  
as a goal, all of the above. yeah, for other brigades yeah it's a we're interested in taking. okay.

 1:00:25  
oh, i don't think, yeah, we haven't documented it.

unknown speaker  1:00:31  
okay. okay.

unknown speaker  1:00:34  
and

 1:00:58  
i actually i think really none of the above. okay. yeah.

 1:01:11  
yeah. think it's actually in the bottom of that. yeah. okay.

 1:01:57  
just captain

 1:02:22  
six years,

 1:02:31  
yes.

 1:02:45  
so i remember a couple years ago, like, for the first couple years that i was doing it. it was definitely looked at, like, weekly, if not daily. or, like every time that i had a meeting or, you know, at least weekly, you know, for the first couple years. and then, honestly, like, from what i remember. like, i thought like it wasn't being updated at all so i actually haven't looked at it and yeah well over a year. okay, so yeah it's great to see that it's getting like another sort of review. okay.

 1:03:37  
yeah. then i sort of got like a plateaued in my knowledge of like running brigade. yeah, right.

unknown speaker  1:03:45  
okay.

 1:04:13  
i have to double check to make sure one is, or i would have to make sure i would have to review it again, to make sure that it's up to date. but, um, and, but if it is then yeah, it would be like eight or nine. okay.

 1:05:09  
i don't know, i guess. yeah.

 1:05:20  
sure, yes.

unknown speaker  1:05:21  
okay. um,

 1:05:32  
i don't think so at the moment. okay. um,

 1:05:52  
nope. okay.

 1:06:10  
um, well i guess my question is, would they be attributed to me or not.

 1:06:28  
option. yeah, i would say, other and that i would be. i would be fine with fine, as long as this can be public or clumsy. yeah. okay.

 1:07:33  
thanks, you too.

unknown speaker  1:07:35  
bye.

",will (open cleveland),,014_opencleveland_2020-11-11_Will-Skora.txt
0," 1:43  
you want me to read it?

 1:52  
yeah, sure. um, my question for this is going to be like, now or when we started for each of these questions, i think

 2:05  
yeah, i can see the list of well, i can see the list of answers, right. this is what yes,

"," 2:49  
k? my question is like, like now eight years in or when we first got started? is sort of my question.

",," 3:31  
um, so like, operationally running days of action is like, we're using at this point, like, you know, finding a venue doing all the food, getting invitations out, like we basically have a playbook for how to do things operationally. occasionally, when we're doing things in a topic area that we don't just traditionally work in or don't have a ton of experience. and then things can be a little challenging. not that we need nothing, an example would help, necessarily, but it's a little bit more of a nuance to the answer of we do this. well, we don't like it part because we're so because every brigade is so local, it's hard to know. like, who are the groups that are doing good criminal justice work in the area? and i don't know that that's something that a playbook could necessarily help.

"," 4:52  
somewhere between two and three

we're pretty good at it.

but i think that like examples can augment what we're doing. but it's like, if we didn't if we didn't have any examples of how people have done this in the past, it wouldn't stop us.

"," 5:25  
depends on the person who's doing it. but i would say generally to

"," 5:34  
i don't really know what you mean by lean, but we do work in an agile way. so i would say probably to

"," 5:47  
oh, for sure. and again, i think a lot of this depends on the individual or the team doing it. so like, like, functionally in the world. i'm a user, researcher, and designer. and so like, doing testing is second nature to me, and to some of our teams that have good people that do that work on them. but like, there are other teams that don't. and then you know, for them, it is more of a struggle. so i think it's really contingent upon the individual project. like as an organization, we know how to do it, but it's patchy or depending on the project.

"," 6:37  
although i think eight years we've had

200 violations, so it's not something that comes up pretty often.

",," 6:59  
it depends on it sort of depends on what code for america wants and have a strategic plan at any given time. so again, it's somewhere i'd say it's somewhere between two and three, we've written them before, but it really depends. an example is useful to illustrate with code for america wants at any given time, but like, if we're just doing something for our own purposes, i don't know that we will use apple. so it really depends on the nature of the question, you're going to ask me to put it in numbers. so let's just say three.

unknown speaker  7:25  
and three. sure. okay.

",," 7:56  
i would say

this is like not what you're looking for. but like, one, one and three? i would say because we do it. okay. i would say we do it well, but i'm always looking to expand our toolkit for new ways to do it.

"," 8:26  
i think a lot of these questions about operational stuff are going to end up being the same sort of thing. like we do it fine. but if there's new if there's new stuff, or like better ways to do it, i'm always open to hearing it. so like, yeah, we do a fine we do it well, one. but like examples release be useful.

"," 8:54  
um, i would say,

branding media strategy, i mean, it's not something we ever really think about too much. so three,

"," 9:11  
onboarding, what was our

 9:21  
and a, i guess, like, i don't know, that we ever like, are people who come to code for boston are primarily interested not exclusively, but primarily interested in working on local issues. so like, we don't actually do a ton of onboarding into the, the national network because it's not in the interest, the general interest base of our membership. so like, i guess three, if you need me to say a number, but really, it's just sort of not really applicable to our membership. okay.

"," 10:04  
um, there wouldn't be there would be useful. i could see i could see three

",,," 10:22  
the that would be very useful i think

as you know, tech is fairly white and in that boston is a fairly white city.

so that would be that would be useful. that would be

i'm not trying to trying to not like max out the severity here.

what we can do with three

"," 11:26  
like you're talking about we're trying to help people professionalizing civic tech, generally build their portfolios, like sort of workforce development has a lot of different dimensions. exactly.

 11:56  
the first thing that came to mind is in massachusetts, our the secretary that do that is called the department of labor and workforce development. so i my first level went to unemployment. but that's because i'm a i'm a state government guy and masters. so that's where my first thought goes. but in the brigade context, i think it's for me, it would probably be around helping people get jobs in civic tech.

 12:40  
yeah, i wouldn't be a little more descriptive language. because like, at least for me, there's two types of workforce development that we might do. one is sort of like just giving people experience doing real software, product, software engineering or design projects, right? yeah, there's a good thing for people to fill out to one getting experience working in a team to gain experience working in a semi professional organization, and to get product they can put in their portfolio. that's like one aspect of it. the other one is like, helping people continue careers in the gulf tech and civic tech field, which is something that we do a lot of, you know, we've played something like 27 people over eight years, and to government and so the tech positions. yeah. so, you know, like, i would say, it could be one of those two things, and i think they're, i think they're separately.

unknown speaker  13:31  
yeah, yeah, i could definitely see that.

 13:34  
one has much more general applicability, then. okay.

unknown speaker  13:40  
i'm just thinking if,

 14:04  
we do like if you want an answer to do we do both of those things. yeah, i think we do them pretty well. and we don't need examples for how to do that. but i think there's a new one. i think there's some nuance in the language there. that's yes, definitely. we should probably refine before we spin this up to a bunch of other people. exactly. yeah.

"," 14:51  
you know, we are a big and old brigade rally. we've been around for eight years. we have something like 6000 people in our meetup group still like generally speaking, things are going well. things i wish we could do better.

we've talked

for a long time about wanting to run concurrent hack nights in other parts of the city. and i know that this is, this is something that places like la and i think chicago do. boston is very patchy in terms of both transit access, and sort of access to technology. so like, i'd love to run a satellite hack night in other parts of the city where people can get to the high tech downtown areas in cambridge and boston, where we typically run our laps. like, i'd love to go to people rather than making them come to us. that's logistically challenging. so that would be a good guide to have.

another thing that would that would be useful is like, how to get press attention. for particular things, like we've cultivated some relationships with press people, but mostly like,

minded times, if it's not, like not happening in the state house or the city hall, like people don't care.

and i think it can sometimes be,

that can sometimes be overshadowed because we live in a city that has a fairly well developed, like, public interest technology ecosystem, in our government partners. like there are digital teams at the city, state, regional and transit layers just in boston. yeah. so you know, when there's tech a tech things happening in government, they're not looking at the volunteers and looking at them to look at the big people.

what else? would it be good for us to know.

you know, it might be better to amplify the question.

the answer there.

i think it has probably limited us in the the kinds of projects and the kind of community that we wish to build.

and i think part of that is because we've spent many years like cultivating relationships with government partners, and less so with community partners. but don't know the creates, we've created, we've created a very good atmosphere, i don't know that we've created entirely the culture that we wish to create. that supports the kinds of population who wish to have a good football.

you know, fundraising is always like a challenge. and like, you know, we talked about before, like, the things that we do, we do find, but i always want to hear about how to get to more sustainable fundraising practices, i think is the big thing that don't involve like sort of a herculean effort by three or four of us, you know, like, once or twice a year, like that sort of, is a bummer.

i think that's mostly it. i mean,

you know, what would be good.

i don't know how you do this, but i'm just gonna say it ahead. so like good guidance on how to track impact of project outcomes. we're very project based group. and so we we have some bars that we put into our product development processes, like most of our project must have a partner before we'll take them in. so like, we already know, the project's most part will get out into the world if we complete them. but we don't always have great ways of tracking the impact. and a lot of that is like, if we build a thing for a partner, like

impact is what they do with it. right.

so it's hard to measure impact there. it's hard to measure like the impact that individual volunteers get out of engagement with cultural boston. like, we know that it's there because people keep coming back and seem to be happy. but it's hard to measure in any meaningful way. especially because like, you know, on people's off time, they don't really want to fill out surveys and paperwork. and we see this the brigade survey of the reagan census.

so

unknown speaker  20:26  
that's difficult. yeah.

 20:34  
yeah, you know, operational yourself most of the things at this point.

when i went off on paternity, we solved like, the, everything revolves around one person problem. so that was a great. it was a little bit of a minor crisis, but it was great.

unknown speaker  20:57  
yeah, i think that's mostly it. okay.

"," 21:13  
a man yeah, probably. sure.

i think for some brigades, i think

one challenge that we've always had with working with trying to provide stuff for other brigades is like, the things that we're concerned with, because we're so big or like, tend to be issues of scale. like, you know, how do you raise enough money to sufficiently feed 100 people a week? not like, how do i get 10 people to come to my event? so if it's useful, happy to do that?

yeah, i think there's some stuff around project intake.

i think there's some stuff around sort of like,

like the rhythm of hack, night and orientation.

we use a good intake form for projects, and we have a fairly, we have a fairly good process. i think the way that we ended up doing running our remote hack night, even though it came together in the space of about 48 hours ended up being pretty good. there are things that we miss about being in person, but that's not one of them. demo nights is a good process that we're happy to share. okay. and then we've run ignite talks a few times, and that's pretty dope.

unknown speaker  22:38  
yeah. like talk.

unknown speaker  22:41  
okay,

 23:01  
yeah, so we have a form. we have a form that is on our website. and we also have a, like a process diagram that talks about the kinds of things that we we need to evaluate. we have an evaluation, we have evaluation criteria, and a form for intake.

unknown speaker  23:16  
form. sorry, like, how does the form work?

 23:20  
yeah, it's actually it's very simple. we used to have a lot more stuff in the form. and then we realized nobody, were asking questions people didn't necessarily know. and it was too long and onerous. so we stripped it down to basically sort of like, who are you? are you part of an organization and tell us about your idea? okay. and then that, but i think what happens after that is where it becomes good, which is that one, it goes out to our core team, mailing lists, so that we all get it and then it also drops into a channel in slack so that everybody can see you.

we evaluate projects.

fad, basically, that i think alex, and maybe a couple of other people will take that project and sort of like, evaluate it work with the pitch person, the person who pitched it to sort of like, develop the pitch and get a couple of questions answered, like, do you have a partner? what's the user impact? like? there's a bunch of evaluation criteria and then we review it at our monthly leadership team meeting as a team, and you know, we evaluate whether or not it matches boston's mission when the partnership seems sound, whether it seems like something that a viable project for a group of volunteers to do. we try to steer our volunteers away from doing things that are like

that they that they won't necessarily be able to do.

like, you know, work on mission critical tech for city partner

 25:28  
i think it's actually fairly built out. i think it's, it's either a three or four, probably closer to three. but like, i don't doubt that another leader could pick it up with the documentation we have and just run

unknown speaker  25:41  
with it. yeah.

 26:00  
like pac man, i'm sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

 26:14  
like for someone else to use? or just in general?

 26:24  
a lot of it, i think it's just gonna come down to time. so it's like, like, duel? like, could we do it? if you needed us to do it? yes. would it be great if someone wanted to listen to me and matt, jabber about it, take our existing documentation and tie it up with a boat to make it more palatable for somebody else? that would be great.

you know, it's mostly just about time. so like,

i don't think we would need any help. but it would be if we actually wanted to get it done. there would be any help would be, you know, you would get it done correspondingly faster.

 27:16  
probably matter of fact.

unknown speaker  27:21  
and

 27:33  
i got we got let me grab it.

unknown speaker  27:44  
tu tu, tu tu?

unknown speaker  27:53  
is dead simple.

unknown speaker  27:56  
and then let me see.

 28:01  
let me see something really quickly.

while i look for another link, feel free to keep going.

 28:37  
refine refined intake process.

unknown speaker  28:41  
the diagram

unknown speaker  28:49  
here we go. here we go.

 29:02  
can you tell me if you can see

this second document?

unknown speaker  29:16  
flowchart?

unknown speaker  29:17  
yes, yes, i could see that. okay. yeah, so cool. okay.

 29:24  
yeah, so like, we have a fairly well document.

unknown speaker  29:26  
yeah.

 29:30  
and it's been in place for a while and it's been working very, very well.

i am certain there are a bunch of other processes that would be useful for us to to share. you know, i think there's like like the rhythm of hack night. i think for us really works. how we've done remote hack night. stuff, i think is very good.

 30:10  
um, this we have a slide deck that we use for to run hack night. that's a sort of like the introduction, i think in terms of how we run remote hack night. that's not really documented, because it just is, you know, like, that came together very quickly, a. and it's just sort of how we operate now. so instead of like, we, when we're in person, we operate out of a big co working space and has a lot of breakout rooms. so pre covid, we would get together in the middle of the space, we would do orientate where we're doing announcements, and then project updates, and then all the project teams would go off to their rooms and like hack for the rest of the night. and like, that is not dissimilar from everybody getting into one big zoom, and then going off to different, you know, google meet rooms that they have. and that that actually transition was really, really good. but i think like, there's some of the nuances in how we did it that i think make it nice. so like, we made friendly aliases for each team, on the code for boston domain that point to specific google meets or whatever their thing of choices that anybody can just go to like, code for boston slash room slash project name and get to the place they're supposed to be. it makes it a lot easier to share links and tell people where to go. it's just sort of like, small amenities like that, that made it a very smooth process.

 31:59  
no, because we did in about, we did about 40 hours.

 32:09  
yeah. let me see if i can find the

unknown speaker  32:15  
hack night slides.

 32:27  
i can, i think get that for you.

there's no documentation for how we run demos, either. but i have a i'm looking trying to find the slide that hakluyt slide.

oh, here it is. oh, cuz he called it opening. here we go.

so we update this every week. and then

 33:58  
yeah, i think so i think it would be pretty good. i also think the big i can tell you what we're looking ahead what we think the big challenge is going to be so right now like we can reach, like in some ways we can reach a lot more people are people people with a greater geographic spread, because we're all remote. so like people have already dipped in from other parts of the state that typically can get to boston or cambridge, or hack nights. and like, i think the general wisdom is like running an all in person event is easy and running an all remote thing is easy, but when you start mixing modes, it gets hard. because the the people will almost always have precedence over the remote people.

unknown speaker  34:45  
yeah, and so

 34:47  
that can be challenging. so i'm

thinking ahead. we're trying to think about how to do that.

every so often.

yeah, so there's that.

i have like light guidance on demo nights. and it's mostly just like how we run them that i would love, i would love to package up and give to people. because it works. it works super great. and that's just more like a rubric for how long people get to present and the breakdown there.

and it's just like, it's,

it's, what is it? i think it's seven minutes to present. two minutes for q&a one minute to switch mics, that's 10 minutes, you can do six in an hour and have a very predictable evening. and that is a good way that way i can say, okay, i need, i need nine people to fill an hour and a half with a 10 minute break in the middle. and that way, i know exactly what i need to do, how long i need to reserve a space for how much food i need to get at all of the things and it all comes down to being to rigorously enforcing those time limits. and then you need to get somebody to have in here one. yeah.

 36:25  
yeah, every week gets updated. so

 36:38  
i mean, i think it's more just like a little bit of documentation, like, like, this is something that matter. i could write this is easy. this is just sort of like plugging your own. like, it would take one of us an hour to like, strip out all the boston's specific stuff and be like, plug your url here.

that's not that hard. it's a slide deck. yeah.

 37:14  
i want to talk about?

but this is about the guy, excuse magazine towards the bottom.org?

 37:28  
if you end up talking to matt, i'm sure he actually has a ton of stuff you'd like to share.

unknown speaker  37:36  
he

 37:40  
he has a really good way for doing social media and like live streaming that i think might be useful for other people to know. he has like a whole sort of tech setup there. but i don't know the details of it. off the top of my head. yeah.

i'm trying to think of other playbook ii type stuff, because i think a lot of the stuff that we as an organization, and the leadership team have to share is sort of like he

on the ad hoc level.

like if somebody is like, hey, this situation came up, has anybody had this before? like, because we've been around for so long? i think we've seen a lot of stuff. and so we've generally seen a lot of stuff, send people like in the brigade slack are like, hey, where do we do like matt, or matt or i are sad can easily pop in and be like, oh, yeah, this is what we did when this isn't? well, you know, what's the thing i would love to get good guidance on? and maybe it's just we've been sloppy. like, our technical people probably know this better than i do. but like, how to, like sanely? how to sanely run your like,

your hosting setup

for like, technical for technical projects. i think this is a part where you get like many people who have many different opinions. yeah, like, if i have one digitalocean account, because mostly we don't need a ton of hosting. we do so much stuff that's posted about yeah, it's mostly static sites. but like, how do you handle permissions for people in the volunteer group? like, how do you reasonably split up your instances like, like, what's good guidance on how to do technical architecture in this environment? cuz like, you know, what sucks. having a lot of having to pay for a lot of instances or like having 10 trillion different roles. to instances scattered all over the damn universe.

 40:28  
and would like to share. not too i can think of at nine o'clock at night on a thursday. exactly. okay, um, i there are almost certain way somewhere i can think of, but just not right, this precise second.

unknown speaker  40:39  
okay. sounds good.

 41:00  
at this point, so i'm the founder of coach for boston. and at this point, i think we're calling me senior advisor. okay. you know, i was the lead organizer for many years until i had a couple of kittens and can't really prepare them the time they used only one.

 41:23  
that is an impossible question to answer

unknown speaker  41:30  
must be a number. i'll put.

 41:33  
i mean, i can tell you so like pre covid. we had between, you know, like 70 and 100 people every week it had. yeah. many of those were new people, many of those were returners.

you know, regular membership.

it's hard to give you a firm breakdown. you know, right now we have, you know, people who go into our zoom, usually somewhere around 30 in our main orientation, but even that is a bad estimate, because people often go right into their project rooms. and so you don't have to deal with us. yeah, in like, the middle of everything these days. so it's actually really hard to get an accurate count. yeah.

 42:32  
uh, let's see, if we want to look at like, sort of this version of the leadership team. it's probably it's been more or less constant for, i'd say, coming up on three and a half years, four years. i mean, i've been constant since the very beginning. so like, there is at least one person who dates from, like, days zero. but like in terms of most of the people in our leadership team, it's

about three and a half, four years.

unknown speaker  43:01  
okay. have you seen the bo? p?

 43:07  
no, i don't think so. i mean, maybe if i have, like, enrolled in a very early version, but it's not something i consult on regular basis. okay.

 43:54  
design thinking workshop to go over what on?

unknown speaker  44:00  
bonnie says.

 44:30  
i mean, i can answer the first part, like, i think this would be if there is a version of this that i could share, i think for us, it would be best to share our project leads because they tend to be more invested in this sort of activity, and they are the ones who sort of like manage the day to day operations. and so if we're looking at things as sort of like a project level or like sometimes more of like a tactical level that can do a really good thing. but it'll be i think it'll be a different class of information than things at the organizational. right. like those guys never think about fundraising. they just rely on leadership to do fundraising, but how they interact, how they like run their projects, how they interact with stakeholders. there might be some good data there. okay.

 45:35  
yeah, apps? absolutely matzah.

fat is probably a good person too. but you probably already knew that. yeah. matt, matt is a since i've been moved into less of a sort of like, day to day operational role, even though like i come to every hack night in the morning, the project, matt has a ton of operational tricks up his sleeve. that i think would be really, really good to document.

unknown speaker  46:04  
you know,

 46:09  
yeah, i think it's just mazzy. i can tell you right now.

unknown speaker  46:12  
that that came.

 46:15  
yeah, we're like pretty. we're pretty basic here in boston. it's just matthews a guy out here hanging? actually, you're right here. hey, that guy

in the code for america slack.

 46:58  
wanted right there. it's just add matt. at matt is a guy. is he a gaj?

unknown speaker  47:04  
okay.

 47:08  
i'm matt, in fact, i think are the big ones.

from our need, or should

win this make sure i'm not missing anybody meaningful.

unknown speaker  47:23  
annie becky,

unknown speaker  47:32  
the shell project?

 47:44  
no, i think where i would say those are the two big ones, matt in the fad.

for us?

 48:14  
so i sort of alluded to this.

early on, i think

that there are several occasions of sort of like brigade type and maturity that will need different things at different times. and i'm not sure how to capture that in this interview process. but when i think about like, a brigade that's just starting out is going to necessarily be grappling with difference, like a new leader is going to be necessarily grappling with different things than like a more established group with a more established leadership team. and so figuring out how to properly organize data in that way. and then i think also like, like, this is something that m burnett and i talk about not infrequently is like, you know, in mean, it's a very different sort of scene than in boston, right, like smaller towns, less resources, a more distributed network of volunteers than in boston, which is like, you know, not just a big city, but like a major international tech hub, right, like different different problems, and different different techniques and methodologies are needed to run your brigade effectively. and those two kinds of spaces and so how to create a playbook that can accurately speak to people at different phases of maturity and different contexts for brigade organization, i think will be critical to the success of this project. okay.

 50:09  
what's the form in which they will be made public?

 51:03  
hopefully, i wasn't a giant pain in the ass. i'm sorry. if i'm no,

 51:22  
if if i had to give, like a, like a bit of feedback about the, about the format, yeah.

unknown speaker  51:29  
uh,

 51:32  
like, as you can tell by some of my responses, like, not everything falls into, like, these buckets exclusively. so like, i think a lot of it is like, stuff that's working now. but if there's a better way i want to know.

unknown speaker  51:48  
yeah. um,

 51:51  
like, is hacking like working now? yes. could somebody develop an innovation and how to do it in, you know, like, chicago, uptown, or tulsa, or san jose or whatever. and like, it makes people like, much happier. great. like, tell me about it. yeah. but i think like, like the so the answer is sort of like, yes, we're doing it fine. but that's not the whole story. yeah. so i don't know how you get that at scale.

unknown speaker  52:22  
yeah, yeah, that's

 52:24  
right. cuz you're just like, you're just like administering a likert test. but yeah,

 52:57  
yeah, my pleasure. thanks so much. thanks for taking the time.

unknown speaker  53:00  
okay. good night. all right. see ya.

",harlan (code for boston),,003_codeforboston_2020-10-01_Harlan-Weber.txt
0," 1:22  
i still got my books behind me.

 1:25  
i think we're the first meeting of the day.

 1:28  
okay, so they're prepped, but what are they in over there.

 1:31  
i imagine i imagine this folks are in that with a pacific.

 1:35  
sure, so they're 10 o'clock or something over there. and just noticing my lighting is kind of dark. yeah,

unknown speaker  1:44  
see hopefully that's not too.

unknown speaker  1:47  
oh man. um, so

 1:49  
i just found out this is kind of fun kind of exciting. so my husband's been looking for jobs, and actually found something in madison, potentially, it's not quite like his ideal fit but anyway so i applied to actually do something there just to see it with a city, man i got an interview at least so congratulations see thanks yeah, i'll keep you posted but.

unknown speaker  2:15  
hello.

 2:25  
yeah, love your background. okay season.

 4:30  
okay. can you tell me a little bit about what like more background on what bob is, i don't think i really know much about it.

 5:17  
all right. well, it sounds like something i should read it anyway as

marianne miranda  5:20  
i say we haven't used that i don't think it also after it yeah like. so i so automatically. okay wait you didn't put the email for like else i could send like another email because currently the calendly is set up for one person which is eric. so, yeah, like you have a email that we sent out and i could send it to alison. sure, yeah.

 7:17  
okay, no problem.

 7:56  
that's good for me, it's a tough one. but you got it.

 8:06  
yep. yeah, i'll just chat it there too so you can copy it.

 9:47  
it's gonna be good. we'll learn a lot from each other i think i guess

unknown speaker  9:51  
so yeah,

"," 10:01  
do we need so the question is do we need kind of resources or examples on hack night tips in this organizing playbook.

 10:15  
should we hold that fingers independently.

 10:18  
oh, there we go. yeah.

 10:27  
i like the simultaneous one

 10:29  
yeah you don't like be biased. okay, like rock paper scissors.

unknown speaker  10:35  
okay, sure.

 10:36  
okay, okay for scissors.

 10:44  
with me. i'm happy to do that. i feel like we've got a pretty, you know, from my perspective, it would be nice to get like more examples i don't think either of us have really attended a lot of other brigade meetings but we've had some pretty good ones i think i think they've been going well recently but

 11:00  
my only thought was just a couple resources, especially for the virtual meetings just have like icebreaker ideas or kind of a, a couple of different interaction styles that maybe we didn't think of that people have had success with kind of the virtual especially the virtual stuff.

unknown speaker  11:16  
alright, so three. three it is i agree with a three,

"," 11:37  
right ready rock, paper, scissors. right. i'll go with a four two.

unknown speaker  11:45  
that's fine.

"," 12:03  
rock, paper, scissors. okay.

 12:08  
i've always like one more than you. but yeah, that's fine.

 12:10  
i'm happy to. i'm happy to go in that direction,

unknown speaker  12:12  
five or six.

"," 12:48  
yeah, let's look both. yeah.

"," 13:13  
so this would be like, like a ui work, or like a needs analysis workshop. i mean, like i also kind of like you know, not like those design thinking like ideas, oh yeah yeah like a design jam or something. yeah. hmm.

 13:41  
well in eric we did one of those one year i don't remember. were you there for the hennepin county one where laura did that design jam.

 13:48  
i was not there no. okay.

 13:51  
but it was kind of like a you it was almost like a journey mapping kind of, yeah. okay.

 14:01  
all right. okay, i can count down again. okay. rock, paper, scissors.

 14:11  
far yes let's lean towards let's always lean higher maybe

 14:14  
right that's probably the safest. yeah, unless it's like a zero and a six maybe.

"," 14:29  
okay, um, rock, paper, scissors.

unknown speaker  14:34  
oh,

 14:44  
i, it may be my biases i've, i've been a software engineer for like two decades, so this is something i feel like i just do a lot for my job all the time. so maybe that's that's part of the disparity. probably i also think i'm better at it than i am, like most things so.

 15:02  
but i think that's where like, our expertise is pretty different right and i'm more on the data side and we've sort of kind of divided our skills a little in that direction. i think what i was thinking though was just, it'd be nice to have sort of almost like blessed templates from the, you know, i know we've got different styles and in the day job like software developers have a way of doing stuff. but if there were sort of almost like a blessed template structure of how to build like a one page app that's data heavy or that's like sustainable that code for america could kind of get behind and get at least get us on the same page there. that was my 30th.

 15:42  
okay, yeah, i'm happy with. i'm happy with that i won't shirk getting examples for that,

unknown speaker  15:47  
maybe three, maybe three there

 16:02  
probably something we should collaborate more on.

"," 16:16  
all right. um. rock, paper, scissors.

 16:29  
we did have a group in our hackathon this year who did it kind of i thought a nice ux. it was somebody who already had experience in it though so i guess you know if we were to kind of train people up on that, that might be a skill people want to build. and so maybe an example that we could.

 16:46  
yeah. we have some capacity in that, in that area already so.

"," 17:05  
rock, paper, scissors.

 17:10  
let's go for. yeah.

 17:13  
i think maybe some background from what i'm thinking on that, i don't, i don't think we've had any yet i'm surprised like there. it's kind of one of my biggest fears. during a meeting that fears maybe is that way but i assume it'll pop up at some point, and it would be great to have some strategies for that when it happens. i know for me personally, it's like what if somebody who shows up who's more on a china to be political but like would come and say well you can't tell me how to think about this issue because it's oppressing me, whereas like we tend to be like more open and inviting and if they say like, i don't like you know for some reason like they're like very anti transgender or something like that and they say it's oppressive to them that we have to include like thinking about that it's one of those things where it's like, well, our code of conduct is basically like treat other people with respect and if you feel like you're being disrespected like then we have action on that and they could say, oh, i'm being disrespected but it's like i think a lot of us. and i don't want to speak for allison but i think we'd be on the same page be like we we clearly think one perspective is more legit.

 18:25  
well, and maybe one other potential i can see sometimes the way we frame issues like do have. i don't want to say a liberal bias but have a. sometimes, you know, people come with a framing that's so especially in some of the work we've done around policing data you know i think we use words like police violence, which i think is like an accurate word but if you know if we engage folks in the law enforcement community and the words that we choose frame of thing in a way that kind of shuts down conversation i guess i'd want to kind of maybe also the idea, you know, the idea of like words that are kind of helpful, like alternative framing words so that might be kind of nice to have some examples there i like going to the brigade congress i think i learned a lot of really nice ways you know so like one example i can think of is instead of saying, engaged citizenship. i think we changed some wording on our website to say engaged community engagement or something i haven't tried to remember. and we also talk about residents rather than citizens now. and so even some of that. that's a little beyond the code of conduct, but also just how to be mindful in our word choices so we don't preclude conversations, i guess.

 19:40  
yeah, that's a great example because you know for, for a lot of us those those seem pretty much the same, but i think it would it would seem very different if i were not a citizen. i would immediately feel like, oh citizen is not something i am and it could be very exclusionary. yeah, great example.

 20:10  
well, and actually the other thing, this is maybe you know at the beginning of the meetups we usually mentioned the code of conduct and ask folks to go and click into it and that's really nice to have on the code for america website. so we just, we take, we use that a lot and post it. but we sort of as an aside, say if anybody has problems you know feel free to follow up with us but if there's a preferred way for from the code for america level that we should channel people that might be just sort of a good practice we could adjust our practice at the beginning of the meetups to.

 20:42  
i think it would be very educational to hear about people who've been in situations where they've had to deal with these issues in meetings. yeah, that would be something that that i think would be probably like a hard session. for a lot of people but it would be interesting to say like hey we had this happen at our meeting of ours or whatever and here's how we dealt with it.

 21:12  
we're also conflict avoidant minnesotan so any help we can get there. as minnesotans would take it.

"," 21:35  
rock, paper, scissors are first agreement.

 21:43  
um, it's and it's funny eric, i was just having a conversation with barb yesterday too who i think is been attending really consistently and is kind of getting excited and i can't you know we're kind of talking about how is our brigade may be different from like other brigades, and that's what we're talking about is like i think our core team is a little smaller and like the stuff you're able to sustain when you build a bigger core team, like there's just some possibilities that come when you've got like five people versus two so it came up even in yesterday's conversation i think,

 22:16  
yeah, for background if it's if it helps at all. allison, i think both alice and i became brigade leaders, just because we were the ones who are most frequently attending meetings and and other brigade leaders left. and it was just like,

 22:32  
i think groupies turned yeah.

 22:35  
i think we, i think both of us would, would really like, you know, to understand how to better grow our core team for a lot of reasons,

 22:43  
in a way that like doesn't make people want to run away because i think even like we had a couple folks come into the meetings and every now and then they say oh you know if you wanted to schedule something they're like, yeah, no.

",," 23:29  
all right, are you ready. mm hmm. rock, paper, scissors.

 23:37  
and i think one thing i'd clarify there too is a couple different types of projects, because i think the point, i think there's a bit of a bias maybe in in the code for america projects that i've seen more as a data person that that they tend to assume that they're going to be like building an app. not all of them and that i think that's changed a lot actually even the last couple years but i think it'd be nice, especially to not just have a strategic plan example for app specific projects but ones that are like more data oriented or like capacity building or, or also ones that are very short term that's the other thing like ones that are sort of help with a thing for a month and then get out of the way, or do a warm handoff. that's probably more what we'd need because i don't think whereas in as much of a space to like, build an app and maintain it for that i wouldn't want that to be the bias i guess i'd want a lot of a couple of examples.

"," 24:50  
all right. rock, paper, scissors.

 25:04  
budget.

"," 25:24  
all right. rock, paper, scissors. want to sign up. yeah.

"," 25:54  
all right, um, rock paper scissors.

 26:01  
pretty aligned derek. yeah, you

unknown speaker  26:03  
had to think about that one better,

 26:06  
i was kind of like it'd be nice to have an example, just, yeah, just to know what we could be doing.

"," 26:22  
wait, so like, like ways to onboard our members into the national network or

 27:04  
all right. rock, paper, scissors.

 27:09  
man, go for

"," 27:25  
alright. any rock, paper, scissors.

unknown speaker  27:31  
huh. all right.

 27:36  
okay, i'd refer to a five two if that sounds really,

 27:40  
i think, the, the app templates i think are it's the same kind of question in my mind it's like, you know, like, give us a kind of an opinionated structure that we think stands a chance of being open source replicable. they feel related.

unknown speaker  28:00  
maybe for.

 28:03  
and i think that's another one where it's probably something that i do more like often in my day job. so, i at least think i feel like i think i know good strategies, but it's always it's always good to get other examples right and understand what others yes.

"," 28:34  
all right. rock, paper, scissors.

"," 28:57  
okay. rock, paper, scissors.

 29:06  
on this too. i think one thing i've been a little worried about is you know as a, as a volunteer based thing. i do think there's some bias in sort of who has time to show up for the things that we do. you know, so we tend i think get folks who are sort of between careers, who have certain, you know, ability to commit time. and so that that might be another question of how do we arrange our schedule, even in ways that make it a little more possible for people who have yeah have to work a little more nine to five or a little more what are some options there.

 29:47  
yeah, i think that, to build on that that's that's an area where i think we have some really key partnerships, locally with other organizations like the, the blacks and tech organization and equity which is used to be our local tax and tech organization, but we just we have been i think i can characterize it as almost entirely unsuccessful in getting a more diverse group of folks to show up but at our individual meetings or finding more meaningful ways to partner with with organizations that that are, that don't look like ours.

"," 30:57  
all right, um, rock paper scissors.

 31:06  
yeah, i don't i guess this does go with building government partnerships a little too like i do think people look to us as a pipeline for tech for good type jobs, i know a lot of books are injured so yeah, i'll go let's go, maybe four or five. yeah,

 31:19  
yeah. four four seems right. it's not something we focused on i don't think really we have like a jobs channel in our slack group. and that's about as close as we get, like we don't i don't think we really have a relationship with any government agencies where they would post with us or think of us when they're when they're talking about a job, actually the cfa is probably the one that is most engaged with us when i because we we had some cfs cfa position. nationally, to work with either i can't remember if it was the city of st. paul or ramsey county. and then we got really good engagement from whoever i can't remember who it was but somebody at code for america national group reached out to us and said hey we've got this position, and, you know, promote it and you know if people have questions, send us, send them to us but it would be maybe nice for my perspective to have that kind of relationship with local government agencies as well.

",,," 32:35  
alright, ready rock paper scissors. rock, paper, scissors.

unknown speaker  32:40  
nice.

 32:48  
i don't know that we've talked thought about it much as a brigade i don't think you and i have talked about this as much and it just kind of. when you ask the question, dan, i was like, well, maybe it's not something we really do but maybe it's something we could get more into,

 33:02  
and my therapist, we get so many people i think when i think about our demographic of being people who are sort of shifting and building skills and they come to us to build skills. i don't think we do it much but i think that's probably 60 to 80% of people who show up, so it would i think it wouldn't hurt to think about it more deliberately. right.

unknown speaker  33:25  
excellent. yep.

 34:02  
yeah, like one. i mean maybe a couple ones that are sort of coming down our pipe i mean i'm thinking of our last hackathon eric. you know, one project we've been trying to do more as some data analysis to sort of be users of our local open data portals, i think. i think a lot of the city's like are standing up these open data portals, and they get they get more clout and more attention and governments seem more ready to share their people are paying attention and using them and so i'd love for us to be like a sort of power user of that early adopter like and kind of a critical friend, with those a little bit. so that's why i like projects that are more like data analysis, and i think something came out of the brigade. congress that sounded really promising where they were talking about doing a write letters to the editor action day, and we decided to just didn't it wasn't on my radar but i think if we knew about that in advance and did like a letter to the editor action day we could do a little bit of research with local data like to give context to, and kind of draft a letter together that felt like a really nice outlet for that right your congress people on an issue. you know short of building an app right it's like it's like advocacy that's informed in a different way, then that's informed by like a considered group process with that looks at some kind of data and analyzes it.

 35:44  
i don't know if this is bob territory but i know that recently, you know, in the last six months or so i was involved in some conversations with around code for america, and knight foundation cities, which the twin cities is i think one of six to six to 10 or something like that. and i didn't find out about that from the knight foundation i found out about code for america. i had heard about the knight foundation i didn't know like they had a small number of cities and that they were interested in engaging with them but i think it would be great and this is why i don't know if it's bob but it would be wonder if the wonderful if there were some way for brigades to understand. since we just have a local view, like i guess i just assumed that knight foundation was like, in every major metropolitan area united states and doesn't sound like that's the case, since we have, i have kind of a myopic view. it would be great if there was a way for us to get resources about, hey, here's the big, you know, organizations in your city that might be interested in working with you, just so that you can as new brigade leaders, just like hey, maybe this is like somebody you want to build a relationship with, or even, you know, how do you find out what those organizations are, i think for us it's probably like you know sub one, two or three leadership groups, ago in our organization really understood how all that worked. and never wrote it down so alison and i don't really have an understanding of, of how to tie into organizations which would love to hear from us.

 37:19  
mm hmm. okay, especially the ones that have a national presence like that that makes sense to where code for america could sort of be tracking that almost like a matchmaker to that that might be one of, like, hey, you're brigade is maybe a similarly sized city to this brigade, and you've got this connection in both being knights cities, you know maybe talk to each other. right, especially with these with more online meetups too and we may consider how much we continue that after the pandemic. there may be some ways to do like joint meetups between cities and kind of compare and contrast.

 37:56  
yeah, i think it's with night mostly but i, they, they have several events throughout the year where they like you know they're not really contests i guess i don't know what they're called but they like funding rounds and the emails we get from them are like a month before the due date. and it's like by that by that time we just don't have time to organize people even if there's an active project it's really tough. so i think if if we were better able to understand those relationships you know we could just have that dialogue throughout the year, and understand what's going on.

 38:27  
you know what i just thought of this was a topic that came up at the brigade congress to, i think, i think my general like sense of where resources are helpful is anyone who's kind of more of a technology, technologists at heart. who cares about civics, but kind of never took a civics class. it's resources like in that space like it almost. you know a lot of us are sort of nerds in the technology world, and we have the will, but we don't have the training to kind of be the network type people in a way that like community organizing, some people come to the brigade sir community organizing lens to but, but, and so they're, like, potentially more effective off the bat, but helping us have that community organizing lens. and it would almost be nice to have like a civics 101 video or something we could just send aimed at tech, technologists that we could send people to to kind of watch a crash course and say you know here's how civics 101 for a technologist perspective like here's where stuffs built here's your stuffs maintained. it might vary by state but to the extent that we can, we can say stuff like that, we'd send people to that.

 39:50  
i want to highlight an example, i think maybe less than a request that i really encourage folks to other brigades to think about. allison. i think about a year ago had a spectacular idea which, you know, sadly since covid we've kind of stopped doing but

 40:16  
or do you want to wait on that.

 40:22  
right. ask me about that

 40:37  
yeah, allison is there anything else from the brigade congress that stuck out to you. um,

 40:41  
i think part of it was just they were i think everything they were talking about was like in the right direction. so, if you just do what the brigade congress is talking about i think a lot of that was spot on the civics 101 was a big one. yeah.

 42:40  
like the task of trying to give it a title that makes you that forces you to like eric do you want to explain your as well i'm thinking. sure.

unknown speaker  42:50  
so, one of the,

 42:51  
one of the things that alex and i talked a lot of a lot about was that we wanted to get people engaged in a lot of, and do a lot of education and just engagement. maybe stepping back a little bit from always just having developers come to meetings and let's build an application right we wanted to get broader community engagement and felt that education about around certain issues was really important for that. one of my concerns in that area was, it was, we had some spotty attendance at meetings, so it was really one of my big fears was like get somebody to, you know, take time out of their evening to come speak to us and have two people show up. i don't know that they would have cared so much but i felt like i wasn't so excited about that i guess i would say. and then i, you know, alex and i were talking and allison had this wonderful idea which is like let's look for existing events that other people are coordinating that we can promote to our group and say hey we're gonna be there. let's all go you know if you're interested, go to this, we'll have a. and then we can have like a mini session after that, just with the brigade or anybody who wants it but it was kind of, it was a great way to take work off our plates and take pressure off like trying to get attendees if we got a special speaker. and it really also got us. i think people who wouldn't have come just to a regular meetup for us, and it also like if we were at a couple events with a group of people from open twin cities, then we were engaging with other people who attended or other like the speakers or presenters at those events in a way that got our name out there. and i would like to say in a couple of those i think we just had really great points and questions that that people were impressed by and wanted to continue a dialogue, so it was really an all around win for us in a lot of ways, and i think it's probably since i've joined the brigade, not even before i was on the leadership team i think for for me that's like the most impactful thing that that that we've been doing. and of course with covid, that's kind of shut down but you know we had like four, four to six events that it was really, it was really great. and i thought it was a wonderful idea that allison had so i just wanted to put that out there.

 45:12  
yeah. and you're right it is like low stress for us to organize so, and it's also i think for technologists to this is also sort of thinking about a little bit of some of the target folks who tend to show up. many. i don't want to over generalize but they're technologists can sometimes be a little bit. i caught myself among them a little introverted, but if you have some support network to go to a thing, you know, and the thing that we should be amplifying anyways, that was kind of the ideas there's things that there's community groups that should be amplified. and if we can help amplify by showing up for them, you know, i think we went to one of the library member they were doing an open data event at the library, and i think they had like caught caught on that we were going to show up there. they're like, oh yeah, we noticed like you guys are just going to kind of swarm us so about half of us there. i think chrome open twin cities. ah, but yeah

 46:05  
that that was that's the one that i remember i think it might have been one of our first ones and then we had like a meeting across the street at a restaurant for everybody but like mostly it was up in twin cities people but i think maybe we got some people who maybe we hadn't seen before, to come join us at that time, it was yeah it was a great night and i really looking forward to continuing that

 47:06  
rock, paper, scissors.

 47:08  
well it doesn't really need it, i would say, it could be used by another brigade we just write down what we did and, right. it's not that hard. i think there's the only couple things to think about is to not circumvent people's own like signups, right, there's just a couple like nice nicety things that you know we shouldn't post an event and then supersede someone else's rsvp process and there's just a couple things to think about there but.

 47:35  
do you remember for those events, i can't, i can't remember if we had our own meetup for those or if we just have we announced that

 47:42  
we put it on meetup because i think that's the only way people ever notice our stuff so i think we kind of have to put it there but i think you. i think we did make it super clear, make sure you sign up on the face their facebook page too so they know. you know,

 48:08  
yeah, yeah, there's a little bit, there's only another. i think the other thing that, remember we were talking about this and kelly brought this up eric is just being very mindful to that the events you go to aren't political in nature. so there's a little bit of a vetting, that'd be the only other thing those two things i think is just that the event to make it might look exciting, but if it's too. yeah, if it's if it's stands a chance of being organized by a political group, or potentially bias like it might just not be the right choice.

 48:38  
right. for us to i mean i think there's definitely ethical concerns about that we are not an independent like nonprofit like a 501 c three or whatever the designation is so that would certainly be like legally important i think for groups that have that not admission,

 48:56  
but my understanding was as part of code for america we need to be be coding my info, otherwise i think we risk. on behalf of code for america, you know. yeah.

unknown speaker  49:06  
cool.

 49:07  
the only other one i put up there. oh here sorry it was, was bookclubs. yep.

 49:38  
i think it'd be more, you know, writing up a paragraph or two of just things to think about when you're choosing an event and pointing people to it you know i could, it's it's not so much of a formal structure, it's

marianne miranda  49:54  
a suggestion for practice on.

 50:18  
i don't know that there's much of a process for that. it's basically like here's the meetup time. read. comm and read the book. i think we often will say like, you don't have to read the entire text to try to be a little bit more like not make people, you know, maybe to try to get more people to attend even if they can't read an entire entire book or part of it but

 50:43  
yeah there's maybe a couple tricks we have we also i think there's a couple things that i do before scheduling to is usually try to make sure that the book is available from both libraries, you know, minneapolis and st paul. there's just like a couple. maybe things you wouldn't necessarily think about that, we had we haven't really documented so i'd say right now it's not documented but just two or three hurdles we clear. and then yeah we have some phrasing that we always include in the event that says you know don't feel like you need to read the whole thing you can come join the conversation. you know, and read a section that interests you and come talk.

 51:35  
the one thing i think that'd be helpful is in well i don't know that we can offer this, because our, our book club events aren't super well attended and so you know i i think every time we read the books. i always find it really informative, like i think it really shapes ideas that i bring to our meetup. so you know usually you just pick books that i'd like to read and then if nobody else shows up, it doesn't matter but, um, i think it, i think it. or if eric and i both read them i think it improves the caliber of the ideas we bring to the table. but i think some ideas on how to advertise it and use it as almost, maybe even more of a community building. i know book clubs also have a little bit of a socio economic kind of, you know, there's sort of a subgroup of people who are into book clubs, so i think it'd be nice to have some ideas of other groups have ideas too and how to actually make that be like more of an inviting thing and advertise it in a way that it might actually be an uptake pipeline for us to get people interested. especially folks who aren't technologists i think sometimes a book club can get potentially more ideas people at the table, who aren't so tech heavy but it hasn't quite been that uptake pipeline for us yet.

 52:50  
one of the ones to that point ellison that i remember really well is maybe one of the first ones that was on the surveillance, i can't remember the name of the book. but we, we went and we flared a bunch of the law schools because it was really about like surveillance, and legal decisions and the history that united states over since now that we're getting more digital and it's easier to to get like look different kinds of data about people. and i think both of us certainly i thought alright we're gonna go to these law school libraries and post up these things and we're gonna get a bunch of law students who are really engaged and excited about this stuff and i don't think we got any anybody from those but, yeah, i need to figure out like how we could have gotten that engagement in a different way. would have been would be helpful, like because i

 53:34  
think we've seen it as we were thinking or hoping it might be a strategy to get different packets of people who have civic ideas that are different from technologists, into our conversations and potentially our meetups, the one that was really successful was the. oh my gosh, it was about data fetch earth. data feminism and trying to remember, we got like 12 people to show up to that one.

 53:58  
and i didn't cook on that one, so i can't remember

what do you do you have thoughts about like why that one was,

 54:06  
you know what i did for that one i emailed around the women in technology group at the university. and that actually i heard from some people who couldn't show up but they said i'm going to read the book and part of the others that i had here too because i actually talked to a librarian about this because she runs a book club that i'm in and was like, we never get people to show up. and she the library see a similar issue, but part of it is at least by espousing the book publicly people find it, and maybe read it even if you don't know about it. so it's sort of taking a stance on like this is somebody's story that we find worth elevating at least and you know we can maybe even have a list of books that we've read in the past, that's a little more public on our website. yeah, that's

unknown speaker  54:49  
great idea,

marianne miranda  54:50  
because i do think it's at least us saying, we think this book that you know we think these ideas are worth considering and it gives us an ethos, a little bit of like the kinds of things that we care about as a group.

 55:13  
i think our meetup page has the old past of club events. and so you can see how we like describe it to people. and then yeah, you could follow up as well. but that kind of covers at least we've just we've tried to describe it.

 55:44  
i'll throw one out there that i just we just did recently it was really low lift. so, we were on like the free slack plan for organizations and we passed the 10,000 message limit or whatever it was. and so i did notice that they allowed nonprofit organizations to apply so you can apply for a license i think if it's a few under 400 users, then it's free for for that you get like the professional or not full professional but you get like the standard stuff you'd have to pay for. and i was able to sign up for that i thought it was going to be like a huge process and it was really simple. so i'd say, if there's groups that have, and it's based on the active users which is people who've been inactive in the last 14 days in your slack channel so like one of the things is i thought we wouldn't qualify because we have like 500 users. but since only about 50 to 100, are, are ever activate anytime we did qualify for it and it was easy and i didn't, i just filled out a form and i thought they were gonna come back to me with a bunch of questions but they just were like, oh, it's fine. um, so i would encourage folks who maybe are use slack a lot and have not signed up for that and it's it's their brigade size and activity to. that's a really, it was like a 10 minute process for me.

 57:15  
you know, i think related they maybe there's be a section that was my only other thought is this section in the, in the playbook about like freebie stuff your brigade should be aware of. there's one other software that i've had my eye on that we haven't actually used for projects but that i've wanted us to stay aware of called ooh shahidi, it's a mapping software and actually even like the aid map, eric, really could have you if we had caught them early enough, like they ended up building their own map but like that one that we have a lot of projects that require like put a thing on a map that would be one i'd recommend that people look at because it's free up to a certain limit so.

 58:00  
oh, even outsource listed like three weeks after that you should be aware you can take advantage of. yeah, i

 58:08  
know. we always have like a lot of engagement or not necessarily meetups but like when we did code switch. in the past years, we'd have like one session would be like teaching people how to use socratic socratic data sets and then there was another mapping card odb right these just like you know so many projects come and they just want to put things on a map, and just like, oh yeah their cargo no, i'm just more resources, just like alison is saying around those and things like that that brigades are like oh this is not only helpful to projects but also, i think, in our experiences, it's a fair amount of engagement, because people want to come and learn these things.

 59:19  
we're both co captains i think it's safe to say. yep,

 59:31  
12 to 15.

 59:45  
two years,

 59:46  
three years.

 59:47  
yeah, two or three years,

unknown speaker  59:48  
can't remember.

 1:00:02  
i'm sure someone sent us links about it. i just never looked at it or.

unknown speaker  1:00:06  
cool. all right.

 1:00:23  
not for me, i guess if i think of anything, i'll reach out to both of you i assume both of you're in the code for america slack channel rate. yeah,

marianne miranda  1:00:31  
i don't think 10 is but. all right.

 1:00:56  
don't feel like i said anything that couldn't be fully public, but i'll. so i'm open for it but alison is there anything that you

unknown speaker  1:01:03  
know i think it's okay.

 1:01:31  
i guess i'd be fine with a one. i don't know if you want your name out there. yeah, maybe

 1:01:36  
two, okay to just from open twin cities i think there you go, i think i'd be everything you said eric i'd be okay as far as saying and but hopefully nice versus

 1:01:59  
are mind meld yeah.

 1:02:01  
we should have duck duck gray duck.

 1:02:27  
again thanks we're looking forward to. yeah.

 1:02:32  
for this was a good opportunity i think allison for you and me to talk about things we haven't talked about,

 1:02:37  
i know yeah we've had a lot of fun. yeah. all right. have a good day,

",alison (open twin cities),eric (open twin cities),013_opentwincities_2020-11-14_Eric-Ebbesen_Alison-Link.txt
0," 9:34  
let's see. yeah, we'll deal with it. okay.

 9:54  
i'm doing well how are you.

unknown speaker  9:57  
i'm doing well too.

 10:47  
yes, fine. yeah, that's fine. okay.

unknown speaker  10:49  
thank you. okay.

unknown speaker  11:00  
um,

 11:22  
nope. sounds good.

 12:10  
that more baltimore yep, that's it.

unknown speaker  12:20  
can i confirm that

 12:32  
yes, ma'am. that is correct.

 13:34  
i think number three.

 13:46  
i see, okay. okay, so this is like an example that you put up yes,

 13:51  
so the example i would give it a number three.

unknown speaker  13:56  
okay. okay.

unknown speaker  13:58  
um,

"," 14:17  
um, probably a one a one. okay. yeah.

 14:43  
sure. so i give i gave that one on one, because for code for baltimore. we have a couple of projects that we've already identified as what we're, what we want to work on, or what we're, we're going to do, and we kind of planned out the need for each of those projects, ahead of time so we kind of head into hack nights with an idea of what we're looking to accomplish. and we're pretty specific on it went back before you know it was virtual only. we were really just starting to get into the flow of that. but it took a while to get there there was some challenges where you know every every hacklab we kind of explained the same project over and over again and didn't really get any work done. but over time, we found our workflow and kind of had a good stride. we haven't had too many hack nights lately to covid and virtual hack nights are. well, we don't need to have to have them as formerly people just kind of work at their own pace and we get together. okay. but we know what to do. we just haven't been doing it very much lately. okay.

"," 16:11  
yeah. three or four or well, actually a six, i would say six on that one.

yeah, i think we've had some good ideas on on topics. mm hmm. but when it comes to marketing or outreach or getting people involved. i haven't really seen enough to know what i'm doing there i'm a very solutions person. i'm a solutions guy not not marketing or outreach. so if i'm the one organizing it i really don't know what i'm doing there so. okay. i think that there's been some good effort around a sort of packets to help us, but if we don't know how to use those packets effectively then they don't really mean anything. and examples of like do this, a month before do that. two weeks before that sort of thing would be very helpful.

unknown speaker  17:14  
oh, okay.

"," 17:23  
um. that's one for us. okay, we work very closely with the baltimore's with baltimore city, and beyond. a lot of our success. there is driven by our brigade leadership being already in the baltimore city government. so i talked about this a bit at the, at the brigade congress. and, you know, my advice toddlers would would be. find somebody in government, it doesn't have to be an elected official but somebody in some level of government. in a division that that can make an impact and try to get them engaged trying to get them involved, even go so far as to add them as one of the brigade leaders because that'll help foster that relationship between the brigade in the city, and help identify problems that could that could use some solutioning or, you know, kind of get some balls, some of those balls rolling, because there's plenty of problems out there but it's it's hard to identify, like the problem that this is you're gonna come in with great solutions but not necessarily solutions the city can use. so getting a partnership and getting city leadership involved on their level helps make those solutions more be more useful. oh, okay.

"," 18:53  
um, i mean, i think, again, we're kind of a one on this. we've had some good partnerships with local with other local nonprofits like hack baltimore and private partnerships with with companies like billy's technologies, those partnerships we might just be in a unique area where you know washington dc is right down the road. so there's a lot of interest in government in the private sector, so a lot of the private companies are looking for these types of nonprofits to reach out to and to get engaged with, because it helps in. it helps them pursue their goals of, of, you know, coming up with solutions for government in a very, you know, generous way. so it's good for them it's good for us. it might be i don't know how to tell people to reach out other than to demonstrate to their own employer the success that they can have through their brigade. and what that success can mean to the, to the company and it had their company get involved. i mentioned billy's technologies i personally worked for with billy's technologies, i get that. i got them involved with code for baltimore, with some of our covid-19 response projects, and that product, our covid-19 response with with baltimore city code for baltimore believes ended up really making a difference, and the project itself the source code from it, we were able to reuse on other things because we built it as an open source project and it didn't just help the company do something positive. with code for baltimore, but it also helped a company, you know, achieve other goals by learning things, and writing code as a part of code for baltimore so let's get your employers involved and that'll help

"," 20:59  
this will be a three. okay. yeah, i think we, we have some ideas on how to do this sort of thing but i think example from from brigades and they do it better. okay.

"," 21:17  
um, one to two i think on this one. and i know it's sort of sound like i think we, but we do have we really focus on kind of agile methodologies, in our, in our approach to software development, and we do what we can to keep the, the solution as simple as possible. we believe. we believe very strongly in running lean. the just keeping everything as simple and as low weight as possible solution should be able to be run by governments on, you know, with no budget, so that the solution can be you know used by anybody, no matter what. and that's, and can be implemented in a relatively low effort and the scope stays small and succinct to that. there's never, you know, we keep our goal in sight and, and keep it clean so that we don't keep continuously like developing nothing, if you know what i mean like we don't run in circles.

 22:33  
yeah, that's fine. yeah, we put all of our issues into github and we run everything in sort of sprints and, yeah, we run everything very lean.

"," 22:55  
i think. i wouldn't say it's a one but i don't think it's a three. we definitely write unit testing into our development. okay, um, but we don't have i don't think we have good. um, i don't think we have good testing philosophies again we don't we don't really have any dedicated testing folk in the brigade. okay, so we don't have outside of unit testing written into the code that we right. we don't really have anything we know what we need, but we just don't we just don't have the people that are interested in doing that right now. okay. i don't think we need an example but i think is good. okay.

"," 23:56  
um, i mean, i think we could use it. we could use an example on this so this would be a three c. okay. i don't in my tenure, baltimore, i don't remember a single event that violated, nobody ever violated the code of conduct to my knowledge, closest we had was a woman came and was insistent that we work on building a app for, for people to find dancing partners. okay, no wasn't really in the scope of what we do. so we listen to her very thoroughly. and we, we talked discussed it with her and tried to help her find alternatives to get the app that she wasn't built done, but in the end we kind of had to ask her to let us move on because, you know, building an app to let people dance with each other is sounds nice but it's not really a civic tech project. right. so i don't know if that was, that wasn't really a violation of the code of conduct if anything it was an example of how we, we adhere to the code of conduct we listened to our idea, we gave her our attention and then, you know, tried to politely say thank you but we're not really going to do that.

unknown speaker  25:06  
yeah.

 25:07  
so i guess. some examples of how to handle tough situations would be nice.

unknown speaker  25:13  
okay. quick.

unknown speaker  25:16  
i'm

"," 25:25  
i guess have three. okay, um, we have a pretty good core team, but i think some good good examples of, of how other brigades have structured their core team might help inform us on how to get more people involved as part of a core team. right now we just have the four of us and i think it would be nice if we could see some other type of brigade structures there. okay.

"," 26:02  
um, that i think we could use a five or a six on that one. okay. um, we're good at identifying a project and really kind of focusing on the project and coming up with plans around a specific project but i don't know if that's a. that is the same thing as what you're asking. we don't have to my, we don't have a coherent vision for the, for the brigade we don't have a coherent direction. in fact, up until covid. we were working on projects but we didn't have any sort of commonality there wasn't there was just working on projects that we had in front of us covid gave us purpose. but that's that's a unique circumstance. we didn't really have purpose before that, i think, to your question, we could use some examples of how other brigades have identified purpose and then a little bit more purpose driven and, you know, working towards something specific instead of just whatever project comes up. right, okay.

"," 27:18  
that i think we're, we're at a one, i mean we do well at coming up with a plan on how to implement a specific project. so that that we're that we're good at, we're gonna kind of identify what the minimum viable product is not just the minimum viable products but also what we're not going to put in as a minimum viable product so we you know we identify the problem what we can solve with the, with the personnel that we have. and with the time that we have, what we'd like to see and what other people might ask for but we're not going to work on the identity we try to identify that sort of stuff. early on, so that when it comes up it's like yeah we thought of that but we're not we're not going to do that right now because we know we don't have the time. and that that time management is key here because people volunteer the time that they have and sometimes folks so up and sometimes they don't show up and and kind of a really putting into scope what we're trying to accomplish and setting milestones and and saying okay this is phase one and once we're done that, then we can talk about these other things that we wanted to do and those could be phase two. and we're very good at identifying what all that is for a specific project

"," 28:39  
that's a six. i don't know how we raise funds at all i know i think we have. i think we have like a one corporate sponsor one or two corporate sponsors. mm hmm. we were talking at the beginning of 2020 about how to do more fundraising, but then everything got derailed with covid so, um, any examples of fundraising would be great for us, we don't do very much fundraising at all. okay.

unknown speaker  29:10  
okay. what

"," 29:21  
um, i think we're world world, probably two to one, maybe one rule i'm pretty well versed in all of this, i think there's a lot of. i have a very clear vision about how we need to clean up some of that to make it more concise, more concise and more navigable, but we haven't really implemented some of it but even still, it's not like killing us. we use slack pretty well, we have google drive, or google apps set up pretty well. our meetup strategies pretty good works pretty well. and there's some tools that we've leveraged in the past, to help our social media management as well as a part of that. so, you know, using stuff like hootsuite or crowdfire or other tools like that have really helped us with social media management, various plugins we've, we've used in slack to help kind of keep everybody aware of changes that are being made two different projects through github integration and ci cd stuff with travis. okay. i think we're really, really pretty solid with, with that, there's definitely cleanup and improvement we could do on our current setup but we haven't even identified what that is and just haven't gotten around to it yet so we're pretty good with that. yeah. okay,

"," 30:49  
um, i'd say it's a three open thing, i think, like i said, we had some good news media stuff going on social media stuff going on for a bit. hmm, and like it was largely. he largely one person at a time is kind of managing the social media presence, and that that sort of strategy which is isn't bad but when that one person kind of stops or moves on it doesn't create keep a cohesive coherent like consistent message with the brand. so, so, having some examples on how to stay on message how to, how to be better at branding the brigade would be great for us.

 31:30  
yeah. yeah, exactly. okay, that everybody's just kind of tweeting when whatever they want, whenever they want then it might. i don't think any of our messages ever conflicted but the tone is certainly changed dramatically from one person to the next. okay.

"," 31:56  
i'm sorry. could you repeat that it kind of cut off for a second.

 32:04  
um, i think, a three. one that 1334 or five, i don't think is six is necessary, but a lot of folks will come into code for baltimore they'll find us through meetup. and they just kind of come and they don't really know there's a larger code for america. network there, and they don't know what the value to the larger network is either. so i think that would be helpful, some some some sort of example or something to give people a reason to be part of the larger network. okay.

 32:47  
okay, that's fine. make sense.

"," 32:58  
oh, we're up one with an asterisk with an exclamation point on that we have a party, we have a project template in our github, that will set up any other brigade's project with, you know, the civic json file needed for crawling by code for america gives examples of how to use tags, because examples for how to use documentation, it's got it's got all the sort of configuration files necessary to really integrate well with the larger networks crawling and indexing. mm hmm. we have a project in our github right now set up to be used as a template by anybody. so we have great examples that are ready for use by the brigades right now. right and code for dayton is used our project template before. i think a couple of other brigades have used it. and it's you know it's open so the code for america network sees opportunities for improvement on that template. let's improve it. let's, we will do that. and, you know, it's out there for all to use, we're definitely good to go on that one.

unknown speaker  34:06  
okay, great.

"," 34:19  
i think a five, a five. yeah. we were gearing up at the beginning of the year, we have big plans for what we're gonna do as a brigade and then covid really derailed everything. mm hmm. and just being remote all the time is really affected people's availability and you'd think that make folks more available but it's kind of making folks less available, and not least because a lot of us work in industries and at agencies that are affected by covid so we all have new responsibilities and expectations on us by, you know outside things to adjust the covid and everything and we didn't. i don't feel like we had an example structure to fall back on to keep us going through that crisis, we just had to do had to do what we were whatever we thought of, and that i don't think was good enough and at times i think we could have done better.

"," 35:35  
um, i mean i guess i have three. we, we have a pretty good diverse crowd at our brigade that come and go. but i don't know if we do that on purpose or it's just the nature of the city, we're in. okay. the city, baltimore is a really diverse city. so we have, we have good representation from the latino community a good representation for the black community from the white community from, you know, the student population some older people like there's there's there's people of all ages, races and religions and everything that come and go. i don't think we do anything that really pushed for that i think it's just kind of happening. so, i'm, i guess, seeing an example of how to encourage more of that it would be nice but i don't know, i don't know. i can't say that we're, we're a model of that because i don't think we've done anything to try to do that it's just happened that way for us. okay, okay,

"," 36:55  
i guess, too. we don't do enough of it. but we do post when we know of local government opportunities. we know what the posts should be we just don't post as often as i guess we could. okay.

"," 37:31  
yeah, that's something we want to get into so that's a for for us. we have some ideas on how to do that. and, and we've talked about it, we haven't gotten into it yet. but that's definitely something where if we could see some examples to help us plan, when we get there. that'll be great. okay.

"," 38:15  
uh huh. i don't even remember what i labeled as a five or a six, except for the last one, which i gave before.

unknown speaker  38:23  
yeah.

 38:37  
oh yes, i'm, what am i think, i think off the top of my diversity goals for us. i mean, like i said, we kind of already are doing that so i'm not on purpose though so i guess that would be good for other brigades, and we wouldn't say, don't do that as a priority but for us i think our highest priority for help would probably come more around with the, you know, organizing a remote brigade, because we're still we're still struggling in a lot of ways, our projects are moving forward. but as a brigade i feel like we are very stalled as a brigade the brigade itself isn't growing in any way. so that to me would be more important,

 39:32  
um, any any well no i mean maybe, maybe along the in the vein of of the national side of it like, i'd like to see more ideas and guidance on how to interact with other brigades more regularly. okay, that's, that's something about all i can think of right now.

"," 40:58  
what do you want me to write in the chat do i'm gonna write

 41:37  
development management. um, know how to phrase this, like the use of tools like the use of git and slack and github itself github specifically, maybe trello like are they use of like proficiency. yeah. okay. and you said you said tool proficiency

 42:37  
kind of work with each other because we really want to get the projects kind of organized right. they are separate but they're they are they're interconnected they work together that's where i think that's where we gains real strength is right now is that area. okay. okay.

 44:01  
um, well we have, i think, a series of templates that help walk through the stages of everything. so, in this, so for example in the github repo i mentioned before, the template repository. we actually have issue templates and pull and user story templates, and that sort of thing built into github, to help, like, get your process moving and get the project written out in a way that that helps you so we have our documentation like a tech spec the default tech spec with, with explanations of how to fill it out in there. and that helps define what your project is and get you on the rails. like i said, there's the the issues template and user story templates so as you start to create your user stories and plan out what you're going to work on those templates are already there and walk you through it. so most of that process i would say is documented through the use of templates it's like in the, in the thing you're going to use itself it's telling you how to use it.

unknown speaker  45:09  
okay.

 45:35  
yeah i think so, because it's it's flexible enough that it gives them, it gives everybody what you need to do a thing and you can kind of decide how you. you can decide how you're going to implement parts of it. yeah, everything is there and belongs to you like this section with, you know these things and fill out that section with those things and you fill those out and then how are you proceed from there might be up to you but just having that stuff filled out and in the way that we've outlined it. and it's pretty straightforward. i think, yeah, people. okay.

 46:29  
i would say we could definitely use some help in peer review, and maybe packet, like right like i said it's it's templates right now right so some user testing in terms of, you know, almost in terms of peer review like like look over what we have there. if, if there's gaps that people feel or they're let us know that sort of thing. as a review and testing of the process that we already have and helping us maybe pass packaging in another context. so more than just templates, but also maybe guides or something like that it's something that may explain the philosophy of what we're trying to do better. that might, that would be very helpful peer review with peer review like for sure that's, that would be the biggest help. okay.

 47:42  
about your to the template. yeah, i have to give you a link to our delivery manager i'm kind of on a bit of a break from code for baltimore right now while i work on something with, with the federal government and our brigades delivery manager would definitely have a lot more to say about that so let me first give you the. the projects folder i'm on my phones is, kind of, you know, difficult to type. okay.

project template, here we are. there is the project template github repository. okay. i spoke of. and there's the delivery lead for code for baltimore, oh wait i spelled it wrong.

unknown speaker  49:28  
whoops.

unknown speaker  49:31  
that's okay, can type again

unknown speaker  49:42  
code for.

 50:23  
do something we need to do. okay.

unknown speaker  50:28  
um, but, you,

 50:35  
we actually did attend to a document to document, get specifically okay and that this didn't didn't pan out like the the lesson i tried to give. we tried to do it during a hack night like an impromptu recorded session but it didn't, didn't really work out wasn't good as a reusable item anyway. they were very knowledgeable on how to use the tools we just haven't really written too much yet. okay.

 51:32  
yeah. yeah, i would say that's accurate yeah, sounds good.

 52:06  
um, yeah, always peer review i'll always say yes to peer review. okay. packaging. yeah, i mean, i guess that there's a kind of a, a universal template for outlining the use of tools that wouldn't be that would be a help for, for sure. okay.

 52:49  
yeah, i would say maybe. yeah, just know i guess it's this thing i could, i could point to is our website. okay,

which is just code for baltimore.org. that shows some of the integration, but it doesn't really explain anything. okay.

 53:55  
i'm the tech lead. so i help organize and make decisions regarding tech, you know what kind of hosting are we going to use and that sort of thing. okay. i have set up those tools that we've not documented.

 54:27  
that's a tough one to answer. we haven't done a hack night in the wall in a while we were getting a solid dozen or so. that would show up for each hack night. i would say the same core six people, five or six people. there was a core five or six people that everybody else was kind of rotating it was different people every time. and we're getting volunteers from the least technologies besides just myself on a regular basis. so i would, i would say our brigades probably 12 members. 12 real active members, but some of those are rotating. okay.

 55:27  
about a year and a half, okay.

unknown speaker  55:36  
i'm okay

 55:46  
now i've been the tech lead for about a very little less than the other leaders have been in place. so about a year and a half.

 56:03  
i believe i have i don't think i don't remember much about it but i believe i have seen it. okay. it sounds familiar.

 56:24  
probably can't remember the last time we were referred to it. i believe it's come up but i don't have a specific memory of it, but of what we did about it. okay.

 56:55  
um, i mean this is the first that. i think i've interacted with with bob so, i'd say three it's not really helpful or not helpful yet, it's just you know we've had one conversation. okay.

 57:16  
i would say 10. i would recommend that we all all take part so that we can, you know, help you guys help us. yeah.

 57:53  
yes. okay.

unknown speaker  57:58  
um,

 58:08  
yes. bill i

 58:29  
um, nothing, nothing that i can think of. okay.

 58:53  
i'm putting the options in chat.

yeah, i see.

i mean i don't mind if they're fully public. okay, no problem with anything. we talked about here.

unknown speaker  59:11  
okay, great.

unknown speaker  59:15  
um,

 59:39  
very nice.

unknown speaker  59:41  
thank you so much. we're going to robot.

",," 5:59  
i personally think we,

while although there's always room to travel, so we do have

a handful of government partnerships.

but maybe not as designed integrated.

",," 7:09  
we don't do it often. that's not particularly our focus. but i wouldn't say we

are struggling in that area. so i would say

three, and we do it well.

"," 7:41  
as a final word,

what is lean how lean? lean?

so we have a lot of engineers, i would say, i would say it's about

 8:00  
i went through, we do it extremely well, because our onboarding process is quite cumbersome.

but it's not something we struggle at

regarding our audience, which are typically a bunch of software engineers. so they're not like, we're not trying to teach designers or subject matter experts how to code. now we're teaching people that already know

how to contribute. so i would say,

",," 9:11  
we have never had to, i guess there was one instance where we need to apply the code of conduct by a kind of resolve and so i wouldn't say we're like, we're super practice and then because we don't usually have those occurrence, this thing once in literally three years. um,

unknown speaker  9:35  
so i would say, okay.

"," 9:49  
building a core team.

see, i i don't like to give ones because i always love to learn no, we do this extremely well, we have a core team of 13 people, and most of them have been on the core team for over a year. if not, like three years. so i would say it's three, but we do it well.

"," 11:03  
we're actually going to do that tonight. you

mentioned that, i would

say to

practice and messing with a new strategic plan. historically, we haven't been that great. but i personally love doing strategy and i have more time to dedicate to the need. so i'm looking forward to seeing how our current plan comes to fruition.

"," 11:52  
okay, i think our projects are very open ended, we do

unknown speaker  11:56  
end up completing projects

 11:57  
in a decently timing, timely manner.

probably about a year, but we can

always get around to finding our projects.

"," 12:18  
we don't spend a lot of money. and we have gone very large grants, not grants donations from microsoft, i have last us for about three years. so we really have not been raised in a very long time.

 12:40  
we're so fortunate. because no one likes fundraising. none of the members are like, yeah,

 12:58  
like i just want to code don't mean.

"," 13:22  
phase three.

i don't think we do extremely well.

there's definitely hiccups. but we have been doing it for so long that we at least have established private practices. that can always be

unknown speaker  13:38  
cooling.

"," 14:04  
yeah, i mean, i would say three

we don't. i found a lot of research about how our members end up finding us. and it's usually through meetups in google. um, so i don't think we need it that much, at least for our target demographic, or audience that's around this. um, but it's not something more fun. that's for sure.

 14:44  
yes. maybe like a self perpetuating thing because we're not good at social media. so that's like, all of our members come from google and meetups, because we don't do social media. i mean, we do, but not

the branding isn't really bad. we all have a good cool.

"," 15:34  
sorry, looking at the list, i would say

i would say three. um,

we have worked a little bit with other brigades. so that's kind of like the national network. but we definitely aren't like promoting acc, as much. and i, to be honest, i don't really think that's why our volunteers aren't interested. which is why for feigned from promoting those opportunities, because they're more interested in like, actual project work, and not necessarily organizing brigades. and the people that are interested in organizing brigades are on our team, and they do national stuff. so yeah, i would say,

"," 16:32  
three, um, we

have not created a project that

has been tried to or expended to be replicated to another brigade, but we do have a project coming up that we're working on facts

could be replicated to other brigades. so

i think example could be useful. oh, sorry, maybe a four a four because we'd love example, in the future.

",," 17:25  
revisit our mission statement and our

values statement

after theurge point, and so we do include more diversity, propositions

and goals and values.

but we have not set any target milestones per se. so i would say, a four would be great, but we do.

i wouldn't say our

brigade is extremely diverse, but it's definitely not homogeneous.

",," 18:30  
i'll tell you three. um,

yeah, so we, we tend to go a lot of boot camp graduates. being in silicon valley, they're like, i'm here to give software engineering job. so i think it would be helpful to other example, but i don't think it's critical to us, because most of us are software engineers that aren't looking for a job. and so we can, we can kind of intuitively hop in that area. and we don't necessarily need guidance on if we want to employ something like that.

"," 19:27  
rank as five or six, um, got onboarding? i don't know if that's covered in some of the other topics. it might be like loosely or indirectly, but i think it's extremely important to call out because it's a huge issue. i mean, really, with limited bandwidth. onboarding, is definitely a six, you know, not having a proven method has limited arbordale from growing because when you don't have good onboarding, you don't retain volunteers and therefore yeah, okay, just kind of slows or dies. not ours, but yeah.

 20:22  
yeah, sorry, i realized i only have five more minutes. and i was getting, giving a lot of explanations behind my answers. so i apologize.

 20:43  
extra time. i don't know if that's something you would be up to.

 20:56  
yeah, let's do it. okay, so i am jam packed for the next couple of days. are you free on thursday?

 21:13  
i am busy from six city, which takes up all the really good evening hours.

unknown speaker  21:20  
how about

 21:23  
830? is that too late for you?

 21:28  
perfect. 830 on thursday, and you'll send the invite, because you have to assume

"," 22:33  
sounds good. awesome. i'm looking forward to it. thanks for hosting this. i'm super excited for the results. likewise.

 23:04  
awesome. um, i don't know how much it matters, but i find that interesting. um, so if i know how, because i've talked to other organizers occasionally. um, i like to find out how long they've been organizing just to get like an understanding of their experience with the verb age, and any biases or, you know, background information. they're coming in with.

 0:14  
and i as project management,

trying to think about ours.

 1:35  
or volunteer management, yeah, so

i can share the filled out version with you. yes,

unknown speaker  1:48  
i'll share my screen. so.

 1:56  
okay. so i recently built out this spreadsheet. and i presented on the stafford a congress. um, essentially, it's a database of volunteers.

and

here, i have the volunteers. all volunteers plus, especially new ones, they all fill out a form. actually, let me look at this form. so in this form, they'll tell us their full name, their slack name, pronouns, their github username, if they're an engineer, how many events have they attended? how they hear about corporate seo? say, what's their profession? what brought them to come for seo? say, how do they want to get involved? are you interested in leading a project? do you want to be on the leadership team? what skills do you want to contribute? what skills do you want to improve? i think this is super important because we get a lot of

newer

unknown speaker  2:59  
developers

 3:00  
who may have just graduated from a boot camp. so

if we're looking for a more experienced engineer, we

unknown speaker  3:07  
probably want one to

 3:10  
helps us kind of gauge our skill level which isn't

precise and not perfect. but it is kind of

 3:28  
when they sign up.

 4:01  
mean, i just recently heard about it and i was like, oh my gosh.

 4:40  
yeah. so we have a free slack here.

our slack messages

gotchu is extremely painful trying to ask the same volunteer like, who are they were they do they volunteer

so

 8:18  
they should no, no. yeah, they open up that window. i made a copy of it to share. so i got rid of like all of our volunteers information.

 8:35  
documentation, but yeah, i would just say, okay.

 8:58  
you'll you'll need a folder because you need all the forms.

 9:44  
um, no. okay. this

 10:03  
now, this we have all of our project information on the same slide. so we show

at hackney

which i noticed most most hacking, sorry hacking, i suppose for games do this. however, i know that some burgers they tried to

only add to like their website when

we moved away from that because i think maintaining two separate places is kind of a pain. okay.

 10:44  
best practice. i think it works for us, though.

 11:41  
at least for our members, so.

 12:29  
that was some of my readings.

 13:07  
so we can share this link with you? just the way?

yeah, and you can contact me. okay.

 13:43  
no, i think that's about it. we

we recently redid our leadership team about a month ago, but we haven't let that come to fruition fully. so i, i

don't know how, how it's gonna

 14:55  
i would say

30 or 42

 15:12  
i am the

i am the newest leadership team member of the code captains and i have been a co captain for chaff years. my other co captain, she has been with code for sans serif, i think four years. okay.

 17:44  
three with the current state right now.

but if it had much more organizational and operational resources or like,

unknown speaker  17:58  
tools,

 20:16  
three?

unknown speaker  20:19  
sorry. gotcha.

",annie (code for san jose),,013_codeforsanjose_2020-10-19_Annie-Steenson.txt
0," 4:58  
yeah, good to see you. yeah, i'm jacob. yeah, captain english. so, yeah, which i guess you probably already knew. but yeah, so i can hear you in la or time or.

 5:30  
i think we have a lot of lag.

 5:42  
yeah, good. okay, how about now, respond to this.

 5:47  
okay, that's pretty good. okay, great.

 6:03  
it's a little yeah, a little nerve racking overall with everything going on.

 9:12  
yes, right. yep.

"," 10:38  
i would say, we do this fairly well.

i will preface that with that we have very few members like active members like usually five at a time so so far it's been easy to organize. and since we've only had one active project. it's also been easy that i haven't had to deal with say like splitting up groups to work on separate projects and whatnot. so, one yes we do this well but it's also easy right now, so. yeah.

"," 11:30  
maybe three an example would be useful. so we did participate and this year's civic day of hacking. and it was my first one i actually had ever done in code for america at all. so it was my first time participating and we ran at least one workshop that was specific to our project and not specific to the action areas. i think there was a good amount of lead up to it and a lot of information shared and it was done well for sure. so, but i think having an example even within that playbook would maybe help with knowing what's coming even before like the civic day of hacking, you know, was upon us. same would go for any other kind of action that or any days of action that code for america hosts, so i think an example of that would always be useful.

"," 12:25  
oh, yes. so we.

let's see. five probably

at least i'll preface this as that i'm not totally sure exactly what examples that are available now. but i will just say that having one would be just extremely useful, um, having partnerships within our community has probably been the most limiting. i think in the past, at least.

unknown speaker  12:59  
government.

 13:00  
am i going into much detail on like, do you want me to just give like an individual rating and then keep going, or do you want me to go in depth like i am now.

 13:36  
yeah. if you can't, i'll be brief ish then but yeah, okay, that works, but yeah so government partnerships are difficult. and i think the most difficult thing is, how do you help your government partners, know what they want, or what's useful to them i think that's probably been the hardest thing that we've

encountered. so,

"," 14:08  
um, we've done pretty well with that. so i would say, three still an example is always useful we've just been lucky enough to have at least an individual member who's been pretty connected at least within like nonprofits in boulder. so, but an example yeah definitely have helpful, who

"," 14:34  
yeah, absolutely. that would be super useful for sure. five, i wish i had an example yesterday. yep, that would be perfect. yeah.

"," 14:49  
um, six, maybe, honestly. um, so,

this is probably the biggest issue i have with starting new projects is i don't know how to say commit to deadlines, on a project if i don't even know how much, how many people how many people will actually be available to work on a project at a given time everybody gets busy we're all volunteers. i can't say i'll have this done in a month if i don't even know who will be available to work on it and i guess so. then i feel like that's kind of part of the lean, kind of development, partially at least, so. yeah.

"," 15:35  
um, we've actually done pretty well with this,

i guess. so what's worked well for us is.

well for one we worked with

a university pretty university and doing some user testing on an application that we were developing. and in a way, we actually just we tapped the student talent in order to in order to actually do user testing and do that user testing in an area that was different from our own. we were also lucky enough to have some readers that have some experience where we could do some user testing also in boulder too which was great. so, but i mean that university partnerships thing really helped out i think with identifying some like core issues that we had with our app too.

"," 16:32  
um, i zero i don't know because we haven't had one reported at least, so. okay.

"," 16:50  
i did see that there was an example within the toolkit, and i was happy to see that and it's definitely useful so i would say three. an example is very useful. the thing that i think i have struggled with is. i have been kind of like captain, and also project manager. and it's been kind of difficult to juggle those two tasks at the same time so the thing that would be very helpful for me is i don't even know like, the way that i would transition from that is getting a member who would be interested in being the project manager. and i think that's maybe the part that was most difficult for me is how did that transition period. so that we have more people on the core team so that we can do more. so,

unknown speaker  17:38  
yeah. absolutely.

"," 18:07  
an example would be needed in the future so for sorry.

"," 18:18  
um, yeah, i would say so.

i would say that would be for as well.

i want to have more projects in the future. and really our current project has been kind of touch and go. it's more been based on, i guess, base we've had a lot of scope creep and i want to prevent that. so, yeah. cool.

"," 18:49  
um, zero, um, we don't use a lot of money right or any money right now. so it hasn't really been an issue. i think if we got more members, and once we actually start meeting in person again i think that'll be become more of an issue because i'll want to provide some things to attract members to actually come to the meetings.

but for now i guess that's a non issue. so cool.

"," 19:26  
um, i think we do this, okay. so we struggled with this throughout the year as well. so i would say, three an example could be useful. i'm not sure if we do it exceptionally well but, um, so like we use slack for like instant communication kind of things. github is specifically for development, there's nothing that's non developed and there we used to have a combination of like design and development tasks for example and that just got confusing so we moved over to pretty much anything that was done development related we moved to trello, since that's another free resource that we could just use. so i think we do okay in it. be an example would be useful. there are other tools that people found that were helpful for them. so.

"," 20:22  
um, this is something i haven't really focused on. i was lucky enough that i kind of inherited a brigade that had some okayed branding. and i haven't really worried about it because i feel like there's bigger fish to fry first. so, i three an example would be useful. but yeah, not not something it's a super big issue for us right now.

"," 21:05  
now do you mean members like new members are you just saying myself as in like as a brigade leader, or both.

 21:23  
okay, sure. okay, i guess we'll start with myself. so when i first became captain i had a call at the beginning of this year, with. i'm totally blanking on her name right now. well, i had like the, i think what was a typical call with code for america to kind of go over like what was expected of me. any tips i can find it whatnot. and that was great. i think what i missed out on, and this is, you know, as much my responsibility, but was kind of like having a check in throughout the year, i didn't have one, and i regret not doing that because i feel like i could have gotten advice, earlier about issues i was having within the brigade rather than just me trying to figure things out. so i would say i was good at onboarding i just wish there was more accountability throughout the year. and that's much more something that would be useful for me some people are very go getters and i'm very much. it'd be helpful to think so.

 22:35  
oh sorry, i forgot that. um,

unknown speaker  22:39  
let's see

 22:41  
through.

i guess i don't need an example, um, mostly because it doesn't necessarily, i mean maybe for like onboarding members to like become part of the national brigade maybe a three. but as far as like myself onboarding i feel like code for america did well. overall, so three i guess would be good. yeah.

"," 23:21  
as in like what other brigades are working on is.

 23:42  
okay, i see. sure. i think a four actually i'll need that in the future. the current project we're working on now we're looking to, hopefully, expand past just right now we're targeting just boulder county. and i think, how we can work with other brigades to make that happen would be useful. i also noticed at the brigade conference that we missed an opportunity to maybe make our current project easier that i just didn't realize was there before. so, i guess. five actually. so, that i would have maybe seen that opportunity. and then also for because i'm going to need that opportunity to five probably would be best yeah.

"," 24:44  
i guess three an example would be useful, um, i guess i don't know how the other brigades are doing as far as like being remote overall for us i think it's been neutral positive ish going remote just because our meetings have become more accessible. because before we were at the public library in boulder. and sometimes that's just inconvenient especially when you're coming off of work and whatnot. but being remote i feel like it's a lot easier for members to just hop on a call if they want to. so, but yeah. an example would be useful just to see like what other people are doing that works well for them too. so,

"," 25:36  
yeah, i need a five, i think.

i think in general like i'm just hurting for members. so really, this has been a more of a focus on i need anybody really, that would be willing to join us but yeah five for sure this would be something i want to also work on too so

"," 26:04  
um, yeah, that would be definitely useful we have plenty of a lot of bootcamp graduates that come through. we're looking for also just for like network networking opportunities and doing that with like local government would be awesome too. so, yes, i will give that a five. i wish i had example yesterday. yeah.

"," 26:38  
for myself or me doing that for the brigade or trying to find that for the brigade

 26:47  
yeah i think that would be helpful. hmm, that's a good question. it's not to be honest it's something i never really thought about or have encountered yet. i know i had mentioned that people are looking for like jobs for example. i mean, i wish i had done that. yeah, so i guess that that five i wish i had an example yesterday that i hadn't even thought about doing that in the first place. yeah. bummer. wow, that's a totally missed opportunity. yeah, so five. yeah.

"," 27:44  
um, i think i had mentioned the timelines. i think that was prob that's probably the hardest for me is establishing timelines on projects. i mean that's kind of part of the lean software development, like i said, but i feel like it's also. it's hard. it's just like i don't even know how i can commit to timelines right now when i just don't even know. without also just having like say like do the work myself. so, maybe that one about like that or like how you generate or like how you can accompany or mitigate that issue being like, maybe you're just flowing with new members all the time that you can just assign tidbits here and tidbits there but how to actually reach out to new members and key people. i guess involved. so, that would probably be one or my biggest one i would say, i think i'd mentioned transitioning from a leadership role or to a leadership role would be helpful, the onboarding process was definitely a good start, i think. but maybe if i had, i don't know is that one's kind of difficult just because it feels very situational as well, because everybody will be transitioning from like one thing to another. so, i can see how that one would be difficult to lay out. but then also accountability i think would also be helpful to better like staying connected with the code for america network. i think that's something that i didn't do well, myself, and also keeping my members also connected to the code for america network. so

 30:04  
so this was the issue where i was a project manager. and i became a captain. and it was difficult to juggle those roles. at the same time, and i know my issue now was is that i should have tried to hand off that role sooner my previous role sooner so that i wasn't doing both. but i guess that kind of goes hand in hand with getting new members as well, and finding new members that are interested in getting leadership roles or like how i can, i don't know i guess how i can provide those opportunities i don't know i'm trying to figure out how to word that well. alright.

unknown speaker  30:53  
yeah. okay.

"," 32:08  
i will say no but i could also think about it more up, i'll just say no, just now. nope. yep. all right.

 32:39  
correct, yes.

 32:45  
active, yes, we do have one co captain. he was previously the only captain and he was kind of. he started his own business so became busy so yes on paper no but i'm the currently only active captain yes, sure.

 33:09  
i'm probably like six or seven, including myself.

 33:30  
just under a year started in january

 33:47  
before today or before it was shared during the original post.

 34:11  
i maybe refer to it in january so yearly. yeah. all right.

 34:44  
i was say for.

mostly because it kind of go over it when. oh, should i elaborate here.

 34:56  
well i didn't know if it was like the yes or no where i shouldn't elaborate. okay. yeah. so yeah, i'll give it a four because it made me wish i had referenced it sooner. when i saw it again later this year. and i think the biggest one being like a core team form formation, i wish i had referenced that a little bit more. and i just didn't give it quite the perfect say like five just because there were some things that were missing, that's all. so, okay.

 35:34  
um, i can't remember if i, if i saw it in january or not but i definitely forgot about it if i did, so yeah, lack of awareness.

 35:54  
i would say 10 for sure at least as a starting point.

unknown speaker  35:57  
all right, cool. yep.

 36:29  
um, yeah, sure, i wouldn't mind getting feedback so yeah.

 37:02  
maybe possibly i could reach out to them to see if they would be interested.

unknown speaker  37:09  
yeah, i would say so.

 37:12  
i guess there could be a possible process that might be helpful as making community partnerships. i mentioned that i had one member that at least was pretty integrated with our like nonprofits in our community and that might be a good way, or they might have some tips. i definitely don't have them but yet they might be able to share some information, so.

 37:42  
yeah, i could provide that in the chat. let me look it up really

 38:17  
yeah, that's in the chat now. all

 38:33  
that you should have asked, um,

ice pose not.

i think you were asking me a lot of questions about the bop. and i think the the one that really hit the nail on the head is how much i reference it anyways. and i think that was probably the critical one is like i, for me it's just the lack of awareness, which you know is my responsibility. so i think that was most important so the other questions i don't think so i think the rest are good. so, yeah.

 39:37  
i would say i'm okay with one, that's fine. yeah, fully public.

 39:47  
yeah, well, same to you, i appreciate you, you know, helping out with all this, so damn

 40:19  
yeah. same to you. i hope everything turns out well tonight. oh,

unknown speaker  40:23  
likewise. yeah. all right.

it's the less common spelling with a z and an e. yep, that looks right.

 6:30  
yeah, i have it just off to the well on the next monitor to the left.

"," 8:18  
i think about a three.

"," 8:30  
yeah, i think that one is definitely higher up, maybe five. okay.

"," 8:43  
oh, yeah, that's. that is probably there are five or six let's call that one a file so. okay. we've gotten lucky, but it's, uh,

 8:59  
oh, sorry. i was just say other than being lucky a few times we definitely could have really benefited from more guidance there.

"," 9:21  
ooh, yeah, that one is definitely high up there too. we've only recently started trying to do that. i'd say that's a six.

"," 9:49  
that one's definitely five. we've done that twice with an outside party, supporting. okay. but it's not a not a skill set we have.

"," 10:12  
i think that one is actually. it'll vary depending on who you ask. i'm gonna put it at a three i'm personally at a two but i think in our, in our community. we have a lot of beginner programmers that or people that want to learn how to work with programmers, that could benefit from an example.

 10:41  
and as a little background i used to teach software developers and now i manage a. okay. so yeah, 120 person organization. in, in local government.

"," 11:23  
ooh, yes. in theory, that is something that one or two of us know how to do, but man without examples, it's been been a real uphill slog that's a six.

unknown speaker  11:35  
okay, good.

"," 11:53  
i think that's about a three. we, we haven't run into too many issues there but there's always, always a need to have a better understanding of what it looks like.

unknown speaker  12:06  
okay. okay.

 12:08  
i'll try to not throw too much extra commentary there

 12:39  
yeah, i guess, otherwise it could just be a type form.

unknown speaker  12:41  
mm hmm.

"," 12:47  
yeah, that's a five, we were kind of struggling to get new organizers involved. okay.

"," 13:03  
um, that's also five.

"," 13:19  
that one's probably six

unknown speaker  13:21  
to six,

"," 13:28  
that might be my first zero, only because we, other than allowing people to donate in tandem with a free ticket to an event. our hackathons are always free but we often have the option to donate a few bucks if you'd like. we have not done much in the way of fundraising, our, our funding has been mostly shoestring, and we've gotten some, some funding from partners either in government or community partners that we did events with, and they funded the event plus margin to help us with operational costs.

"," 14:29  
i think that's about it too. for me, it'll probably vary by organizer, but we've got a pretty solid setup going right now, and haven't run into too many hurdles there.

"," 14:49  
we actually had some really good exercises are on that quarter, courtesy of one of our organizers who has since moved to another. well, another district she went to dc.

 15:04  
yeah. um, so i think that one. i actually would put it at a three because that was really only one person who had that expertise. okay. in the past we kind of didn't need it because we had someone who really knew what they were doing, if we were to do that again. we might be stumbling around trying to figure out, well, what do we do here

 15:31  
yeah, she gave us some, some assets that she designed for our visual brand. there's a, we don't have a full style guide but we have kind of a usage guide for those. we, we didn't do any copywriting in there it was mainly just visual assets and design. but i think we're, we're in a pretty good spot in terms of being able to use and reuse those branding assets for at least a couple of years.

"," 16:17  
um, can you clarify is that for onboarding brigade leads or volunteers in general, or something else jen,

 16:34  
sure. um, so for brigade leads. i think cfa has handled that onboarding reasonably well as long as we let them know we've got a new lead that needs to be on boarded. so in that, in that respect it would probably be at one or two. in terms of our volunteers. we generally disregard the existence of the national network until people get interested in what's going on elsewhere. okay. it's, it kind of has created a confused confusing environment to bring people into trying to clarify what's open data delaware what's code for america, what are the projects we do here, what are the national projects. we sort of treat code for america like a partner organization that you can work on a project with. and then, oh hey by the way people familiar so i think i would probably put this at at a four, because we at this time i think that approach is working well but we probably will see, at some point a change in whether people want to be involved more locally and more nationally and how we actually do that onboarding and having examples of how to do that would be useful. except, you know

 18:05  
oh yeah. um, so for the brigade lead onboarding, um, i was looking at either one or two i think, honestly, i think one. okay. if i'm if in the future onboarding brigade leads to the national network falls to the brigade, then it would definitely get a higher level.

unknown speaker  18:24  
okay. um,

"," 19:01  
oh yes, definitely, um, five. i think that's, that's something that comes up at pregame congress and summit regularly, we all kind of want to know how we can do that better.

"," 19:34  
before covid i probably would have ranted low, it's a it's an important thing but one that we didn't really have a need for now i think having examples would be really useful because we are running all remote we're expecting to continue doing that for a while, and being all remote because we're a statewide brigade allows us to broaden our reach beyond just the meetups that we were holding in only the northern most county in delaware. okay. so i think current situation, taking into consideration, i think being able to get examples for running a remote brigade. i would probably put that at a five.

 20:50  
yeah, i was just gonna say i think in, at least in the economic space they call it creative destruction. hmm. um, there's a. there was an article on npr recently that talked about that but it was an excerpt from planet money which podcast and npr show and they've talked about that a few times. so i think they must have covered creative destruction and the startups that are coming out of needs as a result of the coronavirus as part of that link, but it's also happening in the volunteer space. yeah, brigades and other organizations.

"," 21:50  
yeah. uh, all of our brigade liens have been white people have a fair amount of privilege. so, yes, that's that's a high rank. i think that's probably going to be a six, i don't think we're fully aware of where our shortfall has been, i know we definitely have not been particularly well versed on how we can. how we can focus on dei outreach and making sure that we make space for people of all backgrounds. and that's something that i'd like to see us grow on in the future, i think some, some of it is, is the network effect of when your network mostly looks like you and you are starting a new group you tell everyone you know about it and so everyone that comes to the meeting looks like you.

"," 22:55  
um, we've done a little of that, but there are definitely hurdles i actually work for the state government and even being in government i i struggle to really get that, that connection going because our hr process is somewhat arcane. so i think we, we could use that example at the brigade level but i think it would also be useful to have something available to civil servants to say hey here's how you can connect with your local civic volunteerism community to to get more people in front of your hiring managers. so why don't we put that as a, as a five also.

"," 24:25  
hmm. i think that's about a three. okay. um, it's kind of out of scope for the way that we've modeled our brigade okay but if we wanted to go that direction or if we found that there was a lot of demand for that from our, our attendees we definitely look at that.

"," 25:09  
yeah, i think. so we talked about a lot of the items that we've run up against that have been been hurdles for us. i think one. one thing that's actually been a really practical logistics matter that i don't, i don't remember hearing come up, but could be part of the partner organizations is finding space.

 25:31  
both for small scale events like hack nights project nights. and for bigger ones like hackathons or or large workshops. we've had a few occasions where we, we didn't have a space that worked very well or we had to call in a favor that we didn't really want to spend at the time,

unknown speaker  25:52  
i see.

 25:54  
and other times when the only option was to spend money on a space that we didn't really budget for, and that's occasionally that's where it led to calling in one of those favors. the weird weird he talked about onboarding other leadership team members. i think something we could really use examples of and i think there are some examples in the community possibly in the old bob, bob as well. are defining the, the roles and the structure for the leadership team for brigade

 26:41  
and succession planning, how do we, how do people leave leadership, and how do we make sure that their responsibilities are covered. going forward, because i think we've had, we've had a couple of brigade leads that stuck around longer than they wanted to, because there wasn't really an exit.

 27:22  
one other item. this is sort of a two parter bringing in folks who have underrepresented skill sets. so for us design is one of those. but i know it varies by brigade. for some it's technical skills, project management is another those, those two are in really short supply in our volunteer community for open data delaware. and the other side of it is retaining volunteers who don't have a current project. because we get a lot of people that come in the door, are really interested in getting involved and there's nothing that they can get involved in in their first two or three weeks and then we never see him again. okay. and some of them might have drifted away anyway even if we got them on a project but there are certainly some who were, were really interested and looking for something to get involved in and likely would have stayed. oh, we couldn't get them on board into a project because there wasn't one.

 29:03  
yeah. and there, there may be others that come to mind later but those were really the biggest hurdles that we've run into that we could. i think we would have and probably still would benefit from examples.

unknown speaker  29:20  
okay.

unknown speaker  29:23  
all right.

"," 29:54  
sure, yeah.

unknown speaker  29:55  
okay. all right,

 30:19  
so i've got to actually think about labeling them each with a title,

 30:29  
okay that's fair. so i think that's really a process that we have in place so much as stumbling through something. so, so far i, there are two that i kind of want to look at. okay, community partnership, and event coordination.

 31:44  
yeah, it's my day off so

unknown speaker  31:46  
oh me.

 31:46  
i'm flexible.

 32:01  
so, have that in mind. sure. so i think

it depends on on what parameter you want to look at for value. personally i think i've leaned towards community partnership as the high value one. and then coordination, you can you can get a lot of publicity there, but unless you're having an impact in your community. then why are you doing it. so, for community partnership. the thing that i kind of wanted to discuss or share there is the way that we've recently started working with local community organizations, and this

 33:22  
you might actually have a slide deck somewhere. okay,

 33:31  
actually we, we have a slide deck and a form i don't know if we've used either than a while. but i do know they both exist. right.

unknown speaker  33:50  
okay.

 34:02  
i could scale.

unknown speaker  34:04  
yeah, go

 34:19  
so for community partnership i think we, we don't actually have the process itself documented so i'd say one. okay.

 34:49  
to answer the overall question yes, it was formatting peer review qa or user testing those are the four options.

 35:05  
um, i think we could use a little bit of help with the qa and and user testing approach. we've done this, maybe twice, and it has led to one or two projects. so it's, it has been helpful but it is kind of fly by the seat of the pants, we have a general idea of what the goal is and a few practices that that we have in place that are helpful but not much in the way of documentation

 36:04  
in terms of who to contact or.

 36:25  
we have a forum, i, i haven't found the bookmark for it yet.

 36:34  
yeah. so i think, then the answer is that the next step would be to to ask for or get from us. those two examples, because we do have the forum somewhere. and we had i believe a slide deck that we use to explain what is open data delaware, to a potential community partner.

 37:06  
yeah, that would work.

unknown speaker  37:08  
perfect.

unknown speaker  37:14  
okay.

 37:39  
sync we have an event template for for planning events. okay. it's been a while since we've done an event so i may or may not have that handy.

 38:03  
it's a planning document where we go over a couple of items actually i think it may be two separate planning documents. but we go over, items like the schedule for the actual event. who are the sponsors whether they're title sponsors whether there are sponsors for specific components such as food and drink during the event. sometimes there's a sponsor for a, an award or prize. if it's a hackathon or something else that's, that's competitive or has a sort of judges choice component. and it also includes a very loose budgetary component. it's not a whole separate document but it's a couple of tables with a budget for what's the event going to cost what space going to cost. what do we need to budget in for food based on if we have 10 people 50 people 100 people show up, weird thing to think about right now. yeah.

 39:22  
yeah, absolutely. it has definitely made our, our brigade operations much cheaper. basically the cost of domain names now. mm hmm.

 39:47  
let me look at the ranking system again. i think probably a three. okay.

 40:02  
we don't have formal looking, looking at what i have in folders i don't think we actually have a formal documentation of the process, but we have at least two examples of it in place. so we basically copy and paste and say here's, here's a template we've taken out the event name and the specific amounts for our event and walk someone through what we used.

 40:43  
um, let's go ahead and say yes, and i think peer review would be helpful here, i don't know when we'll, we'll put it into action again, but if it's something that would be helpful to other brigades. i imagine some of the bigger brigades have have a much more robust process that they've got in place. but if it turns out that ours ours would still be useful. we'd be happy to share. okay, so

 41:38  
yeah, we don't have a public version of it that would probably be a good next step for us if we wanted to look at. actually, when it comes to succession the topic we talked about before, probably should put that, and some of the other implicit things about brigade operation into a document. i think we began doing that a few years back, and then it

unknown speaker  42:02  
tapered off.

 42:03  
so it's gathering dust in a google drive folder.

 42:21  
or kind of a historian role. okay.

 42:32  
um, no, not in particular, there, there might be others that that i think of further down the line but those are the ones that jump out right now.

 43:17  
um, so i was the one of the two founders and i'm still one of the brigade leads.

unknown speaker  43:28  
right.

 43:40  
that's a really good question.

 43:46  
that that's a topic we've been discussing for five years. yeah, i, i think with our decreased frequency of meetups and things being all remote and project focused right now. we're probably down to single digits.

unknown speaker  44:07  
um, that's probably five. okay,

 44:21  
we had although people weren't necessarily involved in a volunteer project we had people coming to our meetups pretty often. even if it was just to socialize a little and find out what's going on. and i think that was an important part of our community that we've we have not managed to recreate in virtual format.

 45:21  
it is time anymore. let's see. so it's, it is november of 2020.

unknown speaker  45:26  
mm hmm.

 45:27  
i have been doing this since technically november of. 2015.

 45:37  
yeah, and our other brigade lead eli, who i'm going to see if he can. if he's game to volunteer for an interview like this too. he's been doing it for two years, i think. two and a half,

 46:19  
in terms of the original one that was made in like 2014 or 13.

 46:25  
yes. i,

 46:29  
i clamored for updates to it. a few years ago and didn't hear much back but i think they probably heard that from other people in the network enough that that we got got to this point, or may have been on the, on the plan the whole time and just needed a few other things to be done first.

unknown speaker  46:45  
mm hmm. yeah,

 47:04  
yeah, it was actually, i forget if i mentioned this earlier, we used it in getting started. i looked through the examples that were there and and asked brigade leads in other cities and states, about what they were doing as well when we first got started, and it was really helpful.

 47:46  
can't remember the last time i referred to it. i know it did, but it probably was not any more recent than sometime in 2016.

 48:43  
it's five. good.

 49:06  
in general, or other other brigade organizers,

 49:13  
i have done so at every opportunity when people said hey can i can i start a brigade, how did you do this.

 49:21  
so, probably, nine or 10. let's just say, nine.

 49:40  
there is a there is something that could be done to increase the likelihood that i would refer recommend it, but it's already very likely.

 50:15  
that would be interesting. sorry. oh, phone on the desk.

 50:30  
yeah. so i'm, uh, i'm not sure. i'm just trying to think of, would this be a thing that that might be useful to our everyday volunteers, as opposed to folks involved in leadership. i think i'm gonna say yes. i think it might pique curiosity. and maybe help us with the problem of getting more people into leadership roles in the brigade.

 51:23  
um, so i think it might be a good idea if he's got the time to include the electrical he's one of our other organizers.

 51:41  
they're almost all the same. eturklturk,

 51:56  
i guess is slack handle, i can't remember if he's on twitter, but it might be his twitter handle. it's also his email address if you add@udl.edu. he works at the university of delaware. hey,

 52:34  
um, yeah i think one thing we didn't really talk about that i kind of expected more questions on is open ended discussion or questions on what is your brigade currently struggling with. okay, or what challenges you anything, any of a number of flavors of that kind of question,

 53:07  
challenge challenges hurdles, whatever you want to call them but what our brigade is struggling with trying to trying to figure out how to deal with.

unknown speaker  53:20  
okay.

 53:34  
yeah. i spent all day on it most days so it's it's nice to only have one meeting today.

 54:11  
yeah, that's a good question. um, staff and nack. included in aggregate data. oh, and there's a buyer's remorse option. okay. um, i kind of would like to clarify, because my answer does depend on whether we're talking about public to the cfa community or like it's going to be on the website anyone who's just heard about code for america might be reading this as a testimonial. if it's just the cfa community, which is still a pretty open community i would say one. um, it is the open web anyone in the world can just take a look at it. no additional effort needed, then i'd probably say two. okay.

 55:42  
as a as an employee or a volunteer

 55:53  
yeah, i saw the email so that's um, a common misconception. in the brigade network. the brigades are kind of a thing that emerged, sort of spontaneously from alumni from cfa is original program. but cfa is also a nonprofit with employees, and

 56:17  
so they do partnership with with government, it's sometimes there's like, it's a little opaque. what's going on between the volunteer community in the network and what's going on in cfaes world.

unknown speaker  56:31  
okay. that doesn't matter like intentionally.

 56:54  
yeah, thank you. have a great day. have a great week. and welcome to the code for america community, i didn't realize you were new.

and i will say for a lot of the, a lot of the examples you brought up, like we don't we don't really have much of anything. we haven't done a lot since we started so

yeah it's based on like future

sentiment, not necessarily what i've experienced and had to use in the past.

"," 15:38  
yes. okay.

 17:12  
nonprofit tech mentorship model. okay.

 17:27  
probably none.

 17:54  
i'd say one. okay.

 18:09  
peer review would be great.

 18:27  
emailing or slacking. okay.

is that the right answer.

 19:23  
i founded it, and i lead it.

 19:34  
like, zero. okay.

 19:48  
i started at last fall. okay.

can i add more information or do you want to keep these two synced.

 20:08  
um, i started it last fall and we did one project which was that nonprofit tech mentorship model. and then we started another project, and the pandemic hit, and then

dropped off entirely.

 21:37  
knowledge, not now but hopefully in the future. okay.

 22:22  
i don't think so. okay.

 22:50  
think one is fine.

i cannot on the second mic camera on. oh i do hear echo. oh.

not sure if you hear

might might,

unknown speaker  7:43  
it's fine on my end.

 7:45  
okay, yeah.

i'm gonna hang up and hang up and come back in. okay.

let's see if that's better.

i still hear the echo is

actually really worse or worse.

let me let me, let me try one more time. i'll skip my headphones headphones.

 9:37  
sorry for the interruption interrupt.

no, i'm not sure any other second. let me see.

 9:46  
i suppose it's just weird that i'm hearing the echo each time. it stopped. i'm not hearing it now. have you changed something, maybe, i don't know. i don't know if it's me or you.

ah, now you're frozen. okay,

i can see you again. let's see.

i don't hear the echo now. all right, let's go with that. maybe

paper in good shape. hello.

unknown speaker  10:17  
hello, can you hear me.

 10:19  
yes, i can. i can hear you. ah.

 10:25  
yes, i can hear you very good and i'm not hearing the echo now so maybe two devices we're picking it up i don't know, but it's, it's fine now.

 10:39  
yes, yes. okay.

 10:52  
it sounds fine. and i don't hear my voice echoed so good. yeah. oh, something got fixed.

 11:05  
yeah. who knows, sometimes it happens. i'm used to that happening on a cell phone you ever get that well you're you're on a cell con call, and you hear that echo that's exactly what it was. so i thought, try hanging up a couple of times to see if we get a better line. i don't know, i don't know how zoom works under the covers there, but somehow that echo is happening. well, hello.

unknown speaker  11:25  
hello. how you doing today, i'm,

 11:28  
i'm good. and i've cut.

so jonna.

unknown speaker  11:32  
yes. yes.

 11:33  
great. nice to meet you.

 11:40  
that's fine. yeah, yeah.

 12:31  
so finally recorded. okay. okay. thank you so very especially, especially the way you explained it sounds great.

unknown speaker  12:38  
okay. thank you.

unknown speaker  12:43  
okay.

 13:14  
so the best one to reach me@yahoo.com.

you've reached me before, so.

unknown speaker  13:31  
okay.

 13:39  
yes. yeah.

 13:52  
i'll just type it in. that's my full name.

 13:58  
yeah, kevin, and last name is freeze which most people want to pronounce it fries so it's

 14:05  
yep, but i get it so often the other way that it doesn't matter much.

unknown speaker  14:10  
okay.

 15:02  
oh, so i'm sorry. is there a question to me right now, or you can just go. okay, yeah.

 15:12  
so one is, is going great. and then 06 is not having it okay.

future. okay.

okay, i guess i can follow that. okay.

"," 16:01  
so just wish to have an example yesterday template feature. so all see that example could be useful. okay. it's an interesting ranking system. okay, so i think that that would be a nice thing to have a. just as an outtake. i've only attended code for sacramento meetups and then began running them so i've followed the example of the meetings that i was in, and if i had other examples, it would be nice to see those.

"," 16:55  
okay, so the samples on that. yeah, always more examples would be nice.

we did so i'll say a three again but we

we did run, i think for the circumstance a fairly successful one. so we enjoyed it, we had a series of speakers and we, we, we had a, we had a good time. yeah.

"," 17:29  
i want to do it more. we haven't done it enough. but we do have. we do have people in both state nearby and and city government that we do work with. so, it would be nice to see somebody with a more in depth example on it so i guess a three again would be nice to see ideal like especially if somebody is talking about how you should structure the relationship how i guess contract is the wrong word but like, what are good examples of relationships versus not as good. so we enjoy working with the local government but yeah more will be better. okay.

"," 18:16  
community, i think is the same, probably the same three,

probably the same thing yeah three like it's always good to get more examples maybe a video from somebody who's like here's what worked for us your steps we did to cultivate it. we have numerous partners in the area, but do i do i know if we're doing the best to cultivate that relationship or take advantage of it, or deliver to them things that they don't even know they want from us. yeah, i don't know, i don't know how well we're doing our durango, so yeah three again more examples are better. yeah. okay.

"," 19:08  
uh, is that something is probably a big tell, i don't know if that's something you're asking a brigade to do, is that something that.

 19:40  
yeah, a three to four on that would be good. we don't have a lot of examples for following that our brigade tends to get software developers, sometimes at a junior level sometimes at a senior level, we don't get a lot of sometimes area activists or people who are seeking change. and we don't get a lot in the way of a user experience designer or somebody who i'm used to seeing professionally do interviews with users. so, we make do. we pretend to be designers ourselves but we don't we don't necessarily reach as well into that realm of finding out what users really neat.

 20:29  
yeah, i think, i think it would be it would be really useful to have an example like that would definitely improve things. yeah.

"," 20:44  
uh, i think we're fine on that we, we tend to be fairly scrappy in what we build. i think those of us building us an agile mindset. so, lean isn't far off and i think we're doing fine in terms of that like okay let's get a skateboard going let's get a bicycle going, what do you really need is it running are there people using it. now we'll build the, the extra features on that sort of thing. so i think we're fine there. i don't think so i guess i would say that would be a one for now. i don't think we necessarily need an example. okay.

"," 21:31  
we,

we have not done that much. one of the struggles we have is in building applications that are really driven by user need, there's more of a tendency in our team to be developing things that we think are interesting or not doing enough to build things that users want. so i would definitely say, i wish i had an example like a four to five level. but, but all but what i'll say is, we've had a couple of projects come up that we've worked with the city of sacramento on that were. they were user driven projects. and i'll just talk about the main one that i was doing which is a project to connect neighborhoods with the neighborhood services division of the city, and it fell apart. but, and may pick up again but it was a project designed to help a communication between civically or neighborhood leaders, and the city. and there was definitely user driven we had a good time with actual neighborhood meetings, and that was very inspiring work to follow the city on and to lead on in terms of development. and i hope that that one picks up again. so, i think we've got the examples but we don't. we have trouble. starting projects that are that big we're a small team, so maybe you don't need to be reaching for lots of big projects. but i hope to see more of that in the future.

"," 23:27  
i don't think i've ever had anyone bring up a code of conduct violation, we read it every week. i welcome people to bring up issues that they find with with either myself or with somebody at code for america, if they feel like they want to. and i don't think anyone's ever reached down with a comment from code for america or brigade network to say hey you should change this behavior.

as i say we're a fairly small group,

we're fairly homogenous i would say being basically all software developers. so that may be, it may be more, maybe more that we're a, a less diverse and more that we're more than less diverse and less that we're well behaved that might be a circumstance. okay. so, i think it's i think it's great to keep the, the format in place, and i'm always watchful of it like, how, how are we doing on this, but i think for now. right now is just perfunctory have read out the code of conduct.

unknown speaker  24:38  
okay.

unknown speaker  24:39  
so,

 25:01  
i think i think we do it well so i guess i'll go with a two, um, what i will say is we've had a few publics, like so. occasionally we reach out with more than just our hack night are more than just our biannual sort of events and have like a speaking event, they haven't done that in a year now, but when we have a larger speaking event. we have had a couple of occasions where there's somebody who's out of line and an audience, maybe they're asking the wrong kind of question questions that are not just challenging the speaker on the topic but questioning, i don't know policy and things distracting. so, i think we've addressed those fairly well on those occasions, but i'd always loved the give an example on better ways to deal with that better ways to, to keep an event on track, if that makes sense. that's all. yeah, so, yeah, so that's something i've seen that i'd love to get more skills at. okay.

"," 26:01  
uh, yes, i would like to see more of that. i would like to see example. so, yeah, like, more, more of that in the future would be good i'll give it a four. we have three co captains right now, and good advice from our previous captain. joel was our previous captain. two of us leaders are active we take turns. for instance, delivering the talk at the beginning of the hack nights, or in reaching out, he does a little bit more of the paperwork. i do a little bit more of networking with groups. i think we share well. but i, i would like better examples of structure from from from larger brigades i suppose ours being smaller we won't necessarily have four leaders in a number in a meet up night that takes six people in it. but, but i would, i would appreciate more ways to divide up responsibilities and help keep a more rich leadership group. you know i've been doing this for three years and i meant to be an interim meant to be an interim leader, like, until somebody comes along, who wants to lead this fine i'll keep it alive and we'll make it go. and so, i'm doing that. i'm enjoying it, but it may also be time to hand it off to somebody who's more interested. so i yeah i'm always looking for, who's the next, who's the next leader who wants to take this further. right.

"," 27:43  
i hardly know anything about that. i'll say that sounds great. i wish i had an example, yesterday. sure. okay. no. we have no strategic goals we have. we have a.

we have interested in keeping the,

the attendance high, like we want to bring more people in. and at the same time we have interest in having more projects that those people who come in, have something to do. because we get a fair amount of people who come in, and then drift out, maybe they attend two meetings, maybe they attend one. i don't think we're holding their engagement very well, but and it would be great to do so. but we also need projects to make that happen. so that's, yeah, more, more that we can do to keep interest and grow the brigade leadership and attendance is always better. okay.

"," 28:54  
brigade project alone. i'd love to see an example of the plan maybe it's just something i've never seen and maybe it's ample maybe there's people out there who were like, of course i use the plan. i don't think i've ever seen it. that might have been a good thing. i guess maybe on the last project if there was a plan or examples of a plan that could have kept us more aware of the city's plans and kept us on track. yeah, that that would be awesome. so i'll give it a yeah, which. yeah, i'll go ahead and give it a six, that would be great to have maybe that's something we're just playing missing. mm hmm.

"," 29:41  
uh, sure yeah like like it'd be great to see to see things like that, i'll give it a four, we are. we're doing okay in terms of financial sufficiency. we have a charter with another group with a with a different nonprofit, we have some funds in there that we use to buy pizza and things and do our hosting. so we're doing okay on that level. but we don't have. i guess i listen to enough npr to know that what they really appreciate is people who are on a regular basis donating, even if it's small amounts because it tells you about the level of interest in the community. and so we don't have, for instance, a community partner who funds us on a regular basis we just don't have that right now. that would be great. so i'd love to see models and examples of that sort of thing going on.

unknown speaker  30:36  
okay.

"," 30:50  
based on how small we are. i think we've got all the tools we need for managing it.

if it's a matter of like,

i guess formats of management that would be interesting to see but you know we have our own slack we use meetup for all of our communications. we're all. we're all competent users of github, i think, i think we're using the tools in general, well enough for our team, if we if we grew a lot if we were worried about managing multiple teams of people doing development or something, then, then that would come up but not right now. so i probably give that a one or something. yeah, yeah. okay.

"," 31:42  
that's something we haven't done much of i'm like we have a we have a code for sacramento website, and i know that there are people who have in the past, well actually we've had a couple of people volunteer to be our, our communications person. one of our co captains occasionally does twitter. but we haven't done a whole lot of it lately, especially in the past year just because you know people are a little bit more hunkered down. yeah, i would say that it's been very interesting since we've all been doing things remotely, how different people are coming into the meetups, because they just can. there are people i've seen. i saw somebody come in from new york and here we are in california. they just stopped by they're like, i thought i'd go to one of these meetups and i found one in a time zone that's compatible with me. so i'll show up. and we're like, that's, that's great. and then we actually helped them find, we were like, oh you're outside of boston we'll try the code for boston group if it. if it's compatible with your timezone too. but, you know, you're welcome to stop by here anyway we, so we do some communications outside. we don't have. i wouldn't say we have an active campaign of any kind, which probably would be good if we had somebody who wanted to do a more regular process of communications, i would feel like they could be reaching out to local software companies for volunteer time for fundraising things like that and have a more steady flow. it's not something i have any time for myself. so, yeah, we could use strategy and ways to do it on a, on a shoestring budget of, you know, of not spending much time doing it, that would that would be nice. that would be nice to have. so,

i guess.

i think that, i think that would be nice i'll give it a level, a level four because i think that would be a great thing for the brigade network. to be able to communicate like here for a small group is a great marketing strategy for us. this is easy. try following this plan that we're now

"," 33:57  
so

maybe i need help figuring out what that is beyond paying attention to the slack on code for america, do do that. there's probably a lot more information being shared on that slack than i, that i'm aware of. there are pieces of it that i probably am just not aware of it because i don't actively participate on the channels. sometimes i go there to ask a question, and sometimes i'll see a, an ad here or at channel announcement i'll go. what's, what's that, and then i actually go back and and read it. so i'm overloaded on communication, so that's probably for me something that that i don't take much advantage of me again if we had somebody whose job was to reach into the national network and say, hey, let's go get the interesting parts maybe we could dedicate a person to that. but it's a little challenging because we are a pretty small team. so, i maybe yeah, maybe. maybe i could use an example but i don't right now i don't know what to do with an example, if i had one of how to better use the network.

if that makes sense.

unknown speaker  35:09  
yeah.

"," 35:20  
i think we're okay on that i'm always interested in how to share projects, well, but i don't think that's a big need that we have right now. we've actually utilized a couple of other projects, and you know spun up instances of projects here. and i think we have a project that somebody else has copied out. so, and just taking advantage of one of our own projects, we're going to get experienced with that we have a lease i think this is our own project from several years ago i don't think it's copied from another group called an open budget sacramento, and we've got interest from a from the sacramento county in having a version of that run for themselves. anyway, i think we're doing all right on that end i think the technical side of sharing projects and how to, how to document them, i think we're doing okay on. so, okay.

"," 36:18  
here we are, we're doing it if there's somebody got like some fantastic ideas, i'd love to hear them otherwise we're getting by. we're doing all right. so, yeah, i guess, a. an example might be useful. yeah, maybe there are people with better engagement strategies during those meetings. okay.

",," 36:51  
haven't tried to do that, that would be that would be great. muscle i'll say, i guess i need that. i'll put that as a four because i don't know much about what that is, or how to apply it,

 37:16  
we do all right with that said, we have a few members who show up, or directly related to state government or local city government, and they do come in and pitch, things like that, like, hey, we need to we need a team to do this we need to gis person, that sort of thing. and so we do do that pretty well so could we could we have a format where we're reaching out to the agencies and suggesting that they come by. yeah, that would be nice. i don't, i don't know if there are examples from brigades that maybe encourage more and more of that. that'd be great.

"," 38:09  
we have as a small group we've, we've in the past actively said, like for instance we aren't a teacher of code like we aren't don't come into our brigade and say, teach me how to code. i think that's a really good thing to do for larger brigades. and we've had a couple of sessions. but what we will tend to do for some if somebody comes in and says hey i'm interested in being a coder, our tendency is to direct them off to like a local free. free code camp type group, then let them know that we would welcome their input when they come back. but that that's not, it's not currently a goal that we have. we do get people who we welcome. and it's not that we, we had just explained that we aren't there to teach, but they're welcome to look over shoulders and watch what we're doing. but we do, we do tend to get people from the code camps who have graduated come in and say, alright so now i know how to code. i know how to build a project. i don't have a project do you have one for me or i don't have a job, can you give me a project that i can put on my on my linkedin, so that people can see i'm doing something. and so they're there we're like, cool that's let's make that happen let's make you somebody who is active in a project and and do that. so, so we do that, i think, in a more in a larger, more thriving brigade. that would be a better virtuous cycle like we'd be able to say, hey, let's have the free code camp people show up for a night of hacking and work together on a project and then direct them off to doing lessons again and have people come back. i'd love to see that, but we aren't there yet. yeah. okay.

 40:10  
at. oh, i think, did i say, did i say two did i say three on that one. um, i guess, i do. yeah, i'd say it too on that i think right now you don't need an example on doing that because we would require a larger organization that we don't have right now. for that to happen. yeah.

unknown speaker  40:37  
okay.

"," 40:53  
yeah. um, so, something that i think would be really nice that we enjoy when we have especially like this past. this past congress the national day of civic hacking. we found it really neat that there was a presenter and presentations available that attracted people to showing up for event. and i think it would be really great if possible, especially now that we're all doing things over zoom, rather than our physical meetups, which are, i'll say our physical meetup wasn't very good for presenting a video. but, it occurs to me that it would be really great if there was a i guess a content library for us to show a presenter, or even a live speaker, although timezones make that hard. it would be great to see a more like hey this week, we're gonna present. you know, sally shoemaker who's got a topic on how to manage a project and get. i think that would be awesome. we like to give presentations as well but we don't always have the expertise to deliver a good production, and it would be really neat to have something where, where people learned a lesson coming in on a regular basis, that would that would be awesome, and helps a small brigade. get the interest and get things. i don't know kicked off for the brigade, i think, i think that would be really fun, huh. so, something that occurs to me once a while is hey maybe we should find a speaker, and we're always trying to do that but you know to find a speaker over zoom isn't always necessarily the right strategy or maybe it's difficult to do. and to find one in real life is always challenging, right, find somebody to actually show up at a. at a certain place at a certain time in front of a bunch of people. mm hmm.

 43:13  
yeah. yes.

so, that would be great.

okay, yeah, something we could really use.

unknown speaker  43:23  
great.

 43:32  
okay.

"," 44:04  
i'm sorry i can't think of one right now where i'm thinking wow we're doing such a great job i want other people to follow this lead. so i'm gonna i'm gonna say no on it. yeah, i don't, i don't, i don't see something that we lead on. i would like to, i would like to see that. but my. one thing i've been meaning to do this during during this whole pandemic is to start attending other brigades and see how they function, and see whether there's a comparison to be made and say, oh gosh, we should be do we should take up this practice or boy, i want to talk to the leader because he should take up my practice. i'd love to find that out. but, you know, this is one of the very few opportunities i've had to be a leader in a department like i've done a little bit of software team leading, but i've never run a company i've never really run another organization. and, and no i like it, don't feel like i'm a like i'm ready to set an example in what we do. so, yeah, i would love to love to see the opportunity to view more of it.

 45:35  
serve right so i am a co captain.

i was, i was kind of handed it by our previous solitary captain and, and when he said it to me i said, i don't know that i'm ready to be the only leader of this, of this little organization. and so he helped me find a couple of other people who would also lead it because i said, listen, i, i frankly live outside of the county where our brigade is in. and so for me it was like, i got to drive downtown i gotta go. i gotta go, arrange things i'll run it, but i'd like to have somebody else for backup, and so we found a couple of other people. since then, the other brigade leaders, one of them had to had to move out of the city or out of the county. and another one just is she's so involved in the other. in other activities and other organizations that she doesn't always have time for us. so now i've now i've got another co leader and he stepped in and it's really been helpful. so i guess i view myself as the nominal leader, but the people i work with are are great leaders to have around. okay. and i wish i had more of them. yeah.

 46:53  
i'll go and put the number at about eight will tend to get yeah we'll tend to get about six five or six people to show up at a time. and so they rotate through. and then there are a few people who show up pretty regularly every other week or so they show up, they have some great contributions to make, and then they're gone for the next couple of weeks, that sort of thing happens. so, yeah, i'd say there's there's, there's eight and if i, if i stretched out i could probably find maybe 15 people who show up in a, in a you know in a quarter, but there are people who are definitely like, this is my club i come hang out with them. i go do projects with them. but that's a small tight knit group.

okay. yeah.

 47:41  
a three years. yeah, yeah, the current group three years. yeah, coming up three years. yeah.

 47:56  
i don't think i have.

okay. and if you if you need my brigades playbook. no, i have definitely not somebody would have shown it to me by now.

 48:10  
yeah. yeah, it sounds like something we should build.

unknown speaker  48:18  
okay.

 48:57  
yeah, that would be interesting. mm hmm. interesting just to know how many of them are interested in leadership. right. yeah. yeah.

 49:16  
yeah, my co captain dan fay would want to be involved in that. he's on our on our management or leadership team.

 49:31  
the yeah, make sure i have his email correct.

so make sure that he's involved.

right now, he'd be the most important to have involved i'll just stop at him. okay.

so that's dan. okay. oops. damn, say

there. okay, i did not do a damn thing. yeah. okay.

 50:46  
um, i don't think so this felt really complete like i was it was interesting to get that depth of questioning. i can't think of anything else right now that seems like a good survey out on now.

 51:33  
i think i'm fine with didn't disclose to cfa and nac i think that'd be fine.

 52:06  
and thank you for your time doing this survey i'm sure it's gonna be great value to the team.

hosting half nights

 16:02  
hosting hack nights, i'm.

unknown speaker  16:09  
so,

 16:14  
some preface to my answer here is that, you know, our elections are coming up for new brigade leads. and so, there's kind of two answers to this question. one is like our need today. and what i foresee our need might be. in january, when potentially we have an entirely new leadership team. so we're looking at that so with with that longer view in mind i would answer no three.

three or four. i would say three.

but if i'm only looking at this moment today, like, i would say it's two, but but i think three is the better answer of the long term. okay.

"," 17:12  
i'm three

"," 18:11  
yeah, okay, i was wondering, yes six is what i had said to that question.

 18:22  
okay. yeah, no problem. i thought that that might happen too so i'll try to just kind of

unknown speaker  18:28  
reiterate yeah

unknown speaker  18:29  
that that.

 18:39  
um, is it helpful for me to elaborate on these answers.

 18:55  
um, okay well i mean on that last one about the government partners question.

unknown speaker  19:02  
um,

 19:05  
i would say that

unknown speaker  19:12  
we

 19:14  
we've had our brigade historically has had very few relationships with our local government. my understanding is that we have primarily one that is active. and i think that that also has correlated to one of our most successful ongoing projects. so, from my experience with the number gates work. those government connections are huge and arguably, like a model for kind of what our brigade states, it's striving to do. but given that we only have one of those relationships established, it says to me that we are not. we have not taken that very far. and i think that over this past year in particular, we've actually taken a hard look at some of our projects to date, and i've actually determined that some of them needed to be shut down, and others have just kind of shut down for a complexity of reasons. and we're seeing this large contraction of all of our projects. and i think that this is further highlighting the value of actually having a relationship, an external relationship period, but especially one with local government. because i think the lack of that in many of our projects, has proven to has proven to kind of make them all the more fragile.

that's yeah i guess that's what i wanted to say,

"," 21:02  
um,

yeah, i would say six.

unknown speaker  21:10  
okay, so i'm

",," 22:16  
i guess.

i don't know, somewhere between three and six.

unknown speaker  22:28  
let's go with. let's go with five. okay.

"," 22:47  
five. actually, fucking six minutes six.

",,,," 24:00  
yeah. for this one, like i feel like we have some tools here, but we could use more.

unknown speaker  24:09  
so,

unknown speaker  24:20  
output three. okay,

 24:23  
i got four sorry i get four. okay.

unknown speaker  24:27  
"," 24:29  
oh yeah, i'm.

unknown speaker  24:36  
four.

"," 25:00  
i would say one.

",," 25:17  
what do you what do you mean by that.

",,,,," 27:33  
what network. so one question is like, what, what network are you referring to specifically, are you talking about like the code for american network is that primarily code for america is it. other orgs doing similar work for america's network. okay, but i mean that that that answers it a little bit but not not much like what's included in code for code for america is network, like, can you give me an example. beyond code for america, cool, isn't that network.

 28:11  
zero then. yeah. so

"," 28:35  
so in full disclosure, i haven't had a chance to review the box so, um, is the list of questions that we've gone through so far, i guess, right, the question that i'm asking is, are there, major pieces of the bop that have not been kind of raised through our conversations so far

 29:14  
okay, so we've already. we've effectively already spoken to all of the.

all of the things within there.

yeah, here let's see kink, can you give me one second i'm getting

unknown speaker  29:31  
things up real quick.

 29:40  
sigh spam call anyway. sorry about that. um, okay so other other things a second to think about this, i feel like there's probably something.

unknown speaker  29:53  
um,

 30:00  
yeah i mean i guess like the the whole like remote brigade thing is a big, a big issue, like i think that that. i don't know what the intentions are behind. you know, what would result from the kind of singular question that you've asked so far about the need for kind of tools and support around that. but i would say that that's that's been one of the largest challenges that our brigade has faced this year and it sounds like that challenge will be in place for a good part if not all of next year as well. and so, um, i think that that's something that we. it's like we're not even really sure. you know, when i say we, i'm kind of referring to my fellow leaders of our brigade

unknown speaker  30:54  
that.

 30:57  
i don't even know if we fully understand what we need, or what the problem is there, but i can say that it's not going well. and that half of our leadership team has left mid year, uh, you know, walking away abdicating their duties and leaving. and then the other half is likely not going to return to a leadership role so that means that over the course of this year, we'll have lost our entire leadership team. um, and i think in no small part that is related to the unique challenges of running a brigade remotely so i think i guess what i'm trying to say is i think there's a lot there. and that may. it may be helpful to have more than like for example, an example, or a singular model or tool or document just to help support their that might actually benefit from a complexity of resources.

unknown speaker  31:54  
yeah. yeah.

 31:56  
um, so that's one big piece. another big piece is kind of expanding on,

you know diversity, equity and inclusion like i think that,

like that's its own big piece right like how do we how do we build more representative community in our. org, you know in our brigades and in our work and in our partnerships like that's huge. i would also kind of add that like i think frankly not having better tools and shared understanding about how to confront racism. yeah, has been a huge issue for our brigade and actually arguably the biggest issue that we've faced this year that has led to a lot of, like, people have people quit people have left us but a lot of like tension projects have shut down. it's been arguably an even more. i don't know it's hard to say but like between that and the shelter in place remote pandemic issues, those two combined have like pretty substantially altered the kind of makeup and feel of our organization so i think that like, we, we, our brigade has been severely limited by not having better tools for how to address racism within our organization and our projects, huh. yeah.

like i would write that a seven.

unknown speaker  33:29  
yeah, definitely.

"," 34:40  
okay. um.

hold on i'm still writing him into

unknown speaker  35:01  
it. give me a minute.

 35:09  
still thinking,

unknown speaker  35:34  
oh, right. yeah.

 35:37  
what is this thing called.

that's, that's, that's good enough for me. those three.

 36:03  
project reese.

unknown speaker  36:07  
um,

 36:16  
a template template and example. example of completed templates.

unknown speaker  36:28  
example use cases is. okay. um, so i'm going to paste

unknown speaker  36:37  
in other another

unknown speaker  36:39  
list of

 37:22  
um, yeah i guess you could reach out to myself, or someone else on the leadership team, and we'd be happy to share the documentation with you.

unknown speaker  37:36  
okay.

 38:15  
okay, sorry, type of documentation. so we have, um, we have a model document, like the bylaws itself is a document, so we have that in writing. you know template, if you will.

and then,

unknown speaker  38:35  
um,

 38:38  
as far as other documentation.

i don't know i mean i guess beyond, beyond the document itself, additional documentation about it would probably be in the form of like meeting notes, which is probably not super useful for folks, so i guess it's probably just really that document itself. okay, yeah. and,

 39:36  
i think it's i don't think it's anything that come that complex i think it's more just like the document itself. defines what it is but what it doesn't, what i think would be helpful, the kind of additional context to provide would be why. yeah. i think that the tool itself is fairly clear but what's not clear is like, why you would use it.

 40:22  
yeah, i mean you can find the document on our website. um,

unknown speaker  40:26  
so you can link to it.

 40:30  
sure. yeah. give me one second on that. so, um, so you know you can get the document but as far as like getting additional context of like, why this is important, and, you know, maybe some things to consider when implementing a variant of it for a different brigade, like i think it's basically a conversation that would be helpful. and so, you know, i, or frankly i think yeah i or anyone else on the open open leadership team, at a minimum, would be able to have that conversation.

unknown speaker  41:01  
okay.

 41:04  
let's see. okay.

okay yeah so actually you can find both this document. you can find both the bylaws and the project briefs and our code of conduct, you can find all of them at this link.

unknown speaker  41:31  
wow, that is really nice.

unknown speaker  41:36  
very very accessible right there. yeah.

 41:52  
um, so it's that code of conduct exists as a google document as well as i believe a page on our website.

unknown speaker  42:02  
okay, same data

unknown speaker  42:05  
and how well documented. is it. um,

 42:10  
well, very well documented.

 42:40  
sure, yeah, i mean i think that like, yeah, to a lesser degree than the bylaws, but i think it would benefit from kind of a brief statement of. it wouldn't even necessarily need to be a two way conversation, it could be a singular statement that just kind of frames, the code of conduct. as you know, and that's, you know, for example that statement would be something in the line of like we modeled our code of conduct off of code for america's code of conduct. and we looked at going beyond that template and identifying things that were important for our brigade, and our partnerships and our inner project work, and the community that we're serving.

so, basically say something along those lines.

 44:09  
um, my exact role is i am on the leadership team as a co communications lead, so there's another communications lead we share that identity. and then i'm also the chair of our steering committee, which is the leadership body for our brigade. okay,

 44:39  
oh, that's a good question. um,

i could with a bit of work i could get a more precise answer. um, but i won't be able to do that on this call, so i'll have to kind of guesstimate.

unknown speaker  44:53  
yeah, that's fine.

 44:55  
yeah, so

i would say as of late, our active membership is probably in the like 30 to 40 range. and that's kind of emphasizing the active part, i imagine when you consider folks who just may have been skipping out on meetings for a while but like we'll probably return to doing some work within the next year, you know that numbers, maybe closer to 50. but

unknown speaker  45:27  
yeah,

 45:30  
i would say, i would put it as, maybe. yeah, 30 to 40 anima.

 45:46  
well, so we elect new leaders every year, or rather we you know we hold elections. and people serve one year terms at a time. so, i started my term. in january of 2020, along with two others, and then we had two folks who had served the previous year and continued.

does that answer your question.

unknown speaker  46:14  
yeah, yeah. that answers it.

 47:45  
yeah. um, have you. well yeah, i think you should reach out to just sayin.

unknown speaker  47:51  
okay.

unknown speaker  47:58  
let's see.

unknown speaker  48:07  
i'm

 48:10  
just gonna give you

their email address, i'm pretty sure they would be okay with that. pasted it in chat there um so just saying for context is a you know a fairly long standing open oakland member, and has recently been appointed to share the communications leadership role with me so they are now. you know, as of late on the leadership team for for the remainder of this calendar year. okay.

 49:05  
should might be strong here but i think that, you know this interview comes at a time. that is, especially challenging. yeah, arguably, already challenging work. and so, you know, i,

unknown speaker  49:26  
i guess, you know.

 49:28  
in addition to that, like,

i'm stretched pretty thin. it feels like many people are, um, and that's all the harder. when we're talking about volunteer work. um, so, you know, i think that like, you know, i appreciate what i'm kind of assuming, to understand are the intentions behind this interview and this survey and the process and and the document and tool that this is building towards i think that, you know, by and large, our brigade would benefit from better tools and resources. but i think that that's part of it, and then another big part which we haven't really talked about is just like, you know, and i'm not sure how best to kind of frame this but like people are burnt the fuck out i'm burnout, like i want to quit and and and beyond that like it's not that like. it's not that i want to quit because like i'm tired and exhausted and don't have time. the worst part is that like i want to quit because i don't feel like this is actually helping people. i think that we're actually possibly causing more harm than good. um, and that's a huge fucking problem to me and like, frankly, we don't seem equipped to be able to really hold those conversations in depth within our brigade. we've tried and it has not gone well. and so, i see that as missing from this interview from this process, like, you know, basic like higher level questions like how are you, like, are you are you keeping your head above water. if not, like, what would help, because i think that without addressing that. you know, we might have a great tool that no one will see because, because no one's doing the work you know again. yeah.

unknown speaker  51:31  
yeah.

 51:33  
so i don't, i don't know how best to address that like that's a huge one like, i realized that that can be well outside of the scope of, you know, this interview and the survey and and the handbook. but then again, like i think what i would really like to support next year's leadership team with is some documentation around like how to avoid burning out and having to quit before you served a term, right, like, that's huge. we do not have that and i think we need it right now, and definitely will need it in the future.

 53:14  
yeah, well okay then yeah i mean i would say like, how to support and resources and documentation around how to avoid burnout. yes, is huge, and that should be enough.

 53:38  
no, i think that's that that works for me.

 54:14  
well i'm just out of sheer curiosity. what do you mean there's another option. can you,

 54:57  
but i don't necessarily want your name attached to it, okay that's fine i think that for all of all of what i've said on this call, i would prefer the number two option where you exclude my name but you list on brigade, that's going to push for. okay.

unknown speaker  55:16  
i'm just going to

 56:04  
it happens.

 56:46  
it's not a rush on my end

unknown speaker  56:47  
ticket. you'll see what i submitted it will get to sent to.

 57:43  
yeah, good luck hang in there.

unknown speaker  57:49  
okay. all right. well,

 57:51  
yeah yeah thank you for doing what you're doing. i really appreciate it and like i think it will be helpful so so thank you for that. and um, yes they had a bonnie for me.

unknown speaker  57:59  
i will.

unknown speaker  58:01  
alright have,

unknown speaker  58:02  
yeah. take care. take care. bye. bye.

hello. how are you doing,

 3:52  
change my name here. nice monday here in milwaukee it's still in the 70 somehow.

 4:07  
yeah yeah actually i was a family's zoom yesterday and someone all cousins in la are mentioned that it was cold so blocked for, we got like a week here i guess of warm weather

 6:44  
yeah, andrew amdr ew nyaspan.

 8:34  
might say yeah i wasn't sure actually if you want an answer to this.

"," 9:30  
so yeah, i'd say three and i'd say three because i think we do have knights pretty well so i almost chose one but, um, i always think that seeing how other organizations do it could provide you know good fodder for improvements, or, you know, things that we can offer to the community as alternatives to what we're currently doing. okay.

unknown speaker  10:01  
perfect.

"," 10:24  
i guess i need a little more clarity on what exam because they provided a lot of really useful guidance. i think i want to answer this question almost in the context of, you know, preparing your core team to take on this task and i guess in that sense i would say, um, i would say this, i would say five. okay,

 10:58  
but in the context of like you know being given guidance i thought that was very good.

 11:14  
um, i guess. three

slash five.

 11:24  
yeah.

 11:33  
yeah, i realized that many answers are always going to be a little nuance. um,

 11:39  
think that, you know, we get a lot of, you know there's a lot of hard work put into the national like the guidance from the network and i think it's always really good it's just sort of like, you know, where is every brigade at, and you know that also applies to leadership and structural pieces related to leadership.

"," 12:08  
um,

 12:11  
i would i would say on that one five, um. okay. um, yeah and then a little context on that one is like. i think you know there's a lot of good verbal sharing on what certain brigade leaders have done to have communications with leaders at different levels of government. but i think, a way of using the sort of the the national brand of code for america and like, leveraging the name and the sort of the overall work that the nonprofit has done in the network has accomplished i think like having things to lean on there. i think a lot of the tactics, have been shared, and those are good and i think we've made some good inroads, given where we were when we started but.

"," 13:28  
i would say three, because i think we do it well but i'm always could use other examples. okay.

unknown speaker  13:40  
all right, perfect.

"," 13:51  
um, i would say five.

unknown speaker  13:56  
wonderful.

"," 14:02  
five.

unknown speaker  14:05  
all right,

"," 14:10  
five.

"," 14:27  
yeah, i mean how to deal with them. yeah, that'd be great. i mean we've been very fortunate we haven't had any issues but i think yeah being proactive five.

unknown speaker  14:37  
okay.

"," 14:48  
i'm rj three.

unknown speaker  14:52  
all right.

"," 15:00  
five.

"," 15:09  
also five.

"," 15:14  
five.

"," 15:27  
um, i would say to just because it's really hard to, you know, adoption is really difficult. and i don't think you know i'd necessarily feel like it's a great use of anyone's time to, you know, create something of high level like a very significant detail to promote one particular software anything because ultimately like, i think, the best sort of adoption happens somewhat organically when someone can sort of make a pitch and really show people what methods they've used and it can be any thing from something very low tech to something that's more sophisticated and automated. and so i think really just laying out the options and like, even just sort of making comparisons across like free or freemium offers.

"," 16:35  
um, i'll throw that into five two.

unknown speaker  16:39  
okay.

"," 16:45  
um, yeah. i say five. okay.

"," 17:06  
thing.

i'd say we're not suffering a whole lot, because of this right now but i think ultimately this would be a huge benefit. and so, i would say

"," 17:42  
i'd say four to two.

"," 17:55  
that's a five.

"," 18:04  
for

"," 18:21  
yeah, i would say five, and i and i add that i think you know where we saw potential. and, you know, probably will still see potential and benefit from some examples would be sort of in the space of setting up meaningful internships, to try and incorporate all of these different initiatives to get you know university students involved. okay.

"," 19:15  
and you covered them all. there.

 19:21  
yeah and you covered all the ones that like, um, i would say, you know, developing dialogue around, you know, civic tech. not everyone really has any conception. well, not, not everyone has a conception of what it is. and i think part of the strategic planning process, almost requires that. so i guess it's somewhat embedded but i think separately. you know, developing sort of a long term dialogue around what civic technology or public interest technology is and giving and creating space for that same type of like user research and dialogue, being incorporated and i think, you know, to some degree, that also would incorporate a degree. beyond partnering, which is, you know, and maybe this is this is more of the ddi stuff but like making brigades, really, a place where it's not just about tech, leveraging our tech use, but it's a place where people are interested in relevant tools and learning, and it's not just like you have to have, i think people have run into the barrier of thinking that they're not qualified to be involved. okay,

unknown speaker  21:07  
awesome.

"," 24:06  
think that's all i have right now.

 25:15  
um, i say re identifying people already doing the work. and, and developing partnerships.

 25:52  
i think two, i think three is somewhat necessary to but i'd say ultimately to.

 26:24  
we have. we have documentation in draft so we have some like example emails for reaching out to organizations they tend to become dated. mmm hmm. but you know what, right now we're going through a process of reforming our sort of guiding principles and our like our mission and everything. so i that's why i say that it's dated at twitter, at least in the things that i wrote i refer to the mission. but we do have like sample yeah sample outreach information. and, well, yeah and i think that includes a language for like you know what our intentions are in partnering. i guess in terms of identifying like to the title. um, i think, you know, i don't think we have great documentation for how you sort of like me, you know have a presence the developer presence in the community and find ways to actively listen to, you know, those who are doing work, that would benefit from, you know, civic tech approach. but i think you know we we could write, we can write some of that down.

 28:17  
oh you know i guess i would add one thing too, i kind of move up to this and the reason i didn't add it because it's not. i don't see uptake for it is really good, but i think it's it sounds like a horrible start, i would add to my list i'd add.

 29:03  
oh yeah and then the one that you just asked about, um, i would say to, to some degree, but maybe more one and a half. and then in, with respect to this one, which i think is. i do think is just as important, which is why i think we have the most documentation for it. i'd say, i'd say four but. and i think it has a lot of improvement like you know it can develop a lot more from use and improvements and feedback and use. mm hmm.

 30:02  
i would say for where our brigade is, um, and, yeah, i'd say i'd still say the, the one that i mentioned earlier,

 31:15  
i mean, heavy user testing or name, yeah i guess it'd be sort of like in a user research approach would be beneficial for sure. i mean, like, we have some loose guidance, it's not you know we're not really engaging it from a research standpoint we don't really have the, you know, bandwidth for that, um, i also, you know, i'd say that formatting would be helpful too i mean i think we could benefit from standardizing it a bit more. mm hmm. um, and, yeah, i q&a could be helpful too for anyone that's like sort of customizing. maybe templates that we've made for how to reach out as well, like you know, not everything will be immediately. all the like not all the choices will be immediately available or require some customization to develop these templates, you know these templates are examples in a way that are meaningful to the purpose or like that use case.

 32:43  
the process of reaching out.

 32:48  
um, well i think you know what immediately follows and i think it ultimately gets to the project guidance stuff but before that would be like, you know i think matching in and directing and understanding the the nice balance between like, you know, being able to creating space for initiative, but then also, you know, making it making people seem like they're needed, and the place, to some degree.

unknown speaker  33:22  
okay.

 33:43  
um, this is like through our try real quick.

unknown speaker  33:51  
the restart firefox. okay.

 35:06  
um, i guess something that i'd add to the first list of things that weren't included and i don't think that we have a good. i don't think we have a process for this is transition. and like, selecting new leaders. and then maybe, i think. yeah, i think that's, that was korea actually, um, so i think really, that's the only thing.

 36:37  
as hard it's really hard to rank things.

 36:42  
um,

yeah i guess an order of things that i'd expect to happen. value any opportunity opportunities would be. but then that would be followed by the project start up in facilitation work so i guess let's focus on the evaluating opportunities.

 37:42  
a really have any say one. non. yeah. okay.

 38:01  
yeah,

 38:31  
i guess, developing some sort of like, i don't know. develop developing my little guidance around i think you know we could, you know, develop something along the lines of, you know, explore organizations that do this type of thing related to the interests of the people and the core team, as a start and end maybe the initial attendees that aren't oriented towards technical problem solving, or end. in addition to that, look out into their, you know, to the region for initiatives that are more specifically driven to increase the tech workforce and sort of work from those two angles. and then understand, like, you know what their incentives or their motivations are and how those align with those of the brigade, since the brigade is probably one of the few. that's merging these two sort of goals of, you know, developing projects for social impact. and especially, especially as it relates to governance and service delivery and then, you know, being able to use technology in an effective way in developing tech that's work and reproduce that works and is reproducible. am i say works it means like meaningful to the community the local community. and then it's transparent and open source. okay.

 40:45  
um, the next steps for. sorry for like,

 40:56  
um,

i would i would just yeah i think that would you know be interesting to sort of ask specific questions around like how did you evaluate who you were reaching out to, to each brigade and understand from there like what the qualitative responses are, and what themes, maybe you know pop out. so i don't know that everyone has a similar approach or has a great start sometimes being some people think that you know you create the organism that group. you, as people with the promise of, you know, technical resources, and then people will show up. or i think people will just hope that the type of people that have an interest in both things will show up and that will be adequate. um, i think there really has to be, you know, intense, or you know intentional effort put into developing, you know, both sides. and, yeah, kind of selling people on the idea that there's something useful there, and that there is a role that people can play, and that you're not trying to necessarily force people into roles you're trying to support their good work. all right. okay.

 42:34  
um, i would say that the practice would be, yeah and i presented this on this at brigade congress, not this year but last year project facilitation.

unknown speaker  42:45  
mm hmm.

 42:46  
which along comes along, along with the facilitation itself like the guidance which is essentially like questions with activities would be, realizing that there is a role or set of roles that align with someone who might be newer to this space and maybe less technically oriented to help facilitate the bridging of, you know, where people's content expertise, a lot, a lot of lives, and help, you know, kind of create ground rules for fair dialogue that will funnel into concrete tasks for people to work on and develop and test with end users in mind, and i think you know what, you know, could also be a goal is to sort of constantly make it more. more foggy or like less, less clear like who, the developers and the users are like, to some degree, it's good to, you know, to have like experimental scientific practices with like the way, research, but i think you want to be incorporating people with different experiences in a project, even the users or people who represent the users in the development as much as possible.

 44:47  
um, we have, like, a readme. we have, um, i would say a tool. um, and then we have. i would say also, um, yeah, some examples. so i would say that that's pretty well documented. um, okay, i think that is a four.

 45:23  
andrew, read me, we have a,

 46:18  
yeah, i mean, yeah, for now. okay.

 46:36  
in formatting q&a user testing for sure.

unknown speaker  46:39  
okay,

 46:53  
i can share the documentation.

 48:01  
um,

 48:09  
maybe hack night structure.

 48:15  
yeah. oh i oh sorry that's already in the chat.

 48:37  
what they're talking about three right.

 48:53  
the last one would be able to hack night structure.

 49:10  
i mean we have, like, we have an outline, you know, we have an agenda that we use pretty much every time. and we have our slide deck shared so i'll write this down. okay.

 49:32  
um, we have publicly shared slide decks. mm hmm. and the slide decks are also replaced, something that we were trying out for a little while, which was like a digital. a require a digital program so it was just like more of a document like a markdown document that had links. but i think, you know, there we found no reason to keep making that when our slideshow was being shared and could be used in that way. mm hmm. um, so, and we have a trello that we're using month to month now to like a template trello.

 51:02  
before.

 51:21  
i'd say q&a peer review. okay, and formatting already.

 51:40  
um, yeah yes, i feel like having a meeting with our core team would maybe be the best. okay,

 51:52  
yeah, i think you know the the process has been developed, sort of, by combination of us and most lately by one particular core member who's done a really good job helping us organize tasks from month to month. so i think, you know, we'd all be able to touch on the different you know lessons we learned in the development of this and highlight certain at different aspects of it.

 52:44  
i don't think so. i don't think at this time.

 53:32  
um, i am a core team member. okay. remember later.

 53:54  
man, that's tough question. i would say 3030.

 54:14  
to, a year, sorry, a year and let's see, a year, year and a half.

unknown speaker  54:23  
okay.

 54:33  
yeah. in the beginning, more than, more than anything.

 55:05  
um, maybe yearly.

 55:38  
i'd say, three.

 56:31  
i'd suggest that, you know, talk to our other core team members. one is newer, but i'd say specifically, aaron, and brian.

 58:33  
i mean, i guess. one area that you asked about but i think you know probably could deserves a lot of like no detailed discussion would be structure for. yeah fundraising as was mentioned and financing and sustaining a brigade.

unknown speaker  59:04  
in weapons.

 59:11  
i don't know i think like there could be maybe more standardized coordination around budgeting. and it's something that's maybe more active from the, the network or the you know the cfaa side that is a little more like, sort of, would help get brigade in a rhythm to have the right type of correspondences about financial needs and reimbursements and, well, the better systems for that type of thing. okay.

 1:00:12  
of me.

 1:00:22  
yeah.

 1:00:56  
no problem. you too. thank you very much for your time and for doing this.

 1:01:02  
no problem.

0," 5:19  
i'm doing great. how about yourself.

 5:34  
i actually got as it just the two of us, i guess maybe you can give an intro but uh actually got my code for america defections. when i was living in los angeles. so hack for la hack for la has been around for a long time and it's been a very successful in my opinion like brigade and it's amazing how much support and everything you get there, but

 6:09  
i think is new as a comes that's two months. right

 6:29  
yes. yes. do you want to talk like what do you wanna just go into it like what is the blp system or situation.

 6:52  
let's, uh, i guess. i guess well yeah let's go through the script and if there's any other commentary we can talk after the script.

 7:39  
thank you. that's right. the guy is disconnected on the acronym but yes. okay.

 8:17  
it's gonna be insightful for people like me as well so good. i'm glad that you're doing this. yeah, maybe that'll come out as we go.

 8:49  
absolutely.

 9:51  
that's my personal one or you culture phoenix.

 9:56  
use that one says, okay.

 10:01  
that's also accepted the invite. think

 10:48  
i will i will say get, i won't give you a thumbs up, i will.

 11:06  
done. thank you.

 11:43  
i think it's. could you repeat the question. i will haven't

 11:49  
okay, okay.

 11:56  
it does thank you. okay. thank you. yep.

"," 12:25  
hmm. now, is that hosting like the. if i let ask questions, you can

 12:37  
hacknight says that, presumably a hacknight already exists and it's just how to run a the the details of that day, or is it the all the work that goes into setting up the hacknight to get everyone involved there.

 13:07  
well so it's different though it's like if like, if the event is planned. then there's there's top like projects that we know like i have a project backlog, and we can, can get people there like the actual running that is like, how to disseminate the work to the various volunteers and that's much different than getting the project backlog getting relationships. but that's why it's a very interesting question. is it running the hacknight like. either way it's the number six. but the answer down is number six. i think that i have had a little bit of a an example like using hack for la for my experience in hack for la but you know i think that a playbook would be awesome. so, okay. because you're my, you're my quote my clarifying question is yes like how i don't know if that makes sense and if you've been to a few, you're in a you're in a unique situation where the meetings are already kind of plans. yeah, and it's like now that the meetings are planned how do you actually run them. that's much different than getting them on the calendar. but i but hopefully there's a question about that. so, we'll get there. number six, with that.

 14:55  
i do wonder if like the bootstrapping handbook, like how do you go from like no brigade exists in a city to an operating brigade with monthly hacknight it's like maybe that's really, i think, if this if that is if that is covered in this playbook as well that's really something different than running the monthly hacknight so anyway, what we'll get there.

"," 15:45  
very interesting, i feel like this is, i personally don't need an example. number two, mainly because i've been, i've ran two years in a row with the brigade, so i kind of know what to expect. how to coordinate things. but i will say like for number three, maybe it's a two or two or three i could. you can put either which one down but mainly because this year's national day was so much different than years past, and so what to expect and what kind of the example. you know running a virtual event was much different than events i had ran in the past so an example was definitely useful they were actually provided i think by veronica, who was, you know, she had the topic she kind of knew what we're going to talk about and it kind of went really well so. so number three on that one. okay,

"," 17:10  
uh, the most help i can get which is that what which is what number is the most help i can get. i think it's not even an example i think that's i need something else. like i yeah i guess i, i guess, having an example so number six. but i also think that knowing. again, like how do you even start the government relationships. that's so tough. but i don't know if you know the history of the brigade. specifically, there was actually like a abusive relationship where the previous brigade, captain 2017 2016 2017, the maricopa county maricopa county gov, department of public health, which is a, you know, government institution. they actually created a relationship with the phoenix brigade. and we're treating the phoenix brigade like unpaid consulting, we're giving them deadlines, we're giving them deliverables, and there wasn't the, the, i think the brigade leader at the time wasn't like forceful enough, right, you know, yeah. publish to establish the correct relationship between the volunteer network, and the that government entity. and it actually did lead to her burning out or leaving, whatever and and meat kind of trying to come in and in 2018 trying to resurrect the brigade and not, not the best at it right now but we're working on. i think it's not even an example but i think it is like a as much as much help as i can get, so it's it's examples, because that's what the run book is gonna actually produce nothing great. i think also not like not not maybe not only cultivating a relationship but also how to find like not only the hat like a how in a what, rather than the, like, you know, during or something so

unknown speaker  19:31  
important, jump right down.

 19:35  
hopefully otter otter can transcribe all that and

"," 19:58  
that one has been a little bit easier, i think, mainly because of how like you know networked i am was in the community. i said i i don't say that i, i definitely put that in a number six as well. but i will say that i am an example. like, so cultivating is such a weird, a weird, a strange word for me, because i think that what i what i struggle with is actually the incubation of it like how do you start relationships, because all the community lationship i currently have are going swimmingly. but the cleaning company relationships i don't have are the ones that i need help with. and so how do i find and execute those community relationships and keep them, you know, strong, and so i irrigate and if you want to put a six i, you could put a six. if you want to put, you know, four, or something but i would definitely put a six because i think that, you know, you overload your community partners, the partners that you engage with right but there are tons of other community partners that are looking to engage with a brigade network or volunteer network. and they, we just don't know each other exists. so, the incubation of that is much different than me.

 21:56  
yeah, i think it's more like, like, they've come about and i've.

 22:22  
but a root cause i don't know if you want to root cause this whole thing is the brigade, get, i don't know this is gonna be probably a question later but the struggle with a concurrent brigade attendance and engagement. so, we'll talk about that i think later. if not i'll bring that up at the end. but harvesting other people's community relationships. right, and getting them to want to attend then not relying on you know me as an individual tomorrow color to make sure that the phoenix brigade is successful or not.

"," 23:09  
um, example is a example could be useful but number three, i think, you know, again, like i think when when we've had events like this in the past, they've done really well.

"," 23:34  
i. you can put zero, i don't know, i don't even know what that means.

unknown speaker  23:43  
all right.

"," 23:52  
um, that personally i think i have an example like number four, i think an example would be uploading the future. i think that we're nowhere near doing anything that would require users right now. so i think that that would might be might be might be helpful in the future when you know we have some things happening.

"," 24:30  
you know examples are always useful, i think. but the whole problem with examples are every case is unique. and if you want to. example could be useful. number three. however, i will say the general guidelines that have been provided in the past by code for america have been pretty, pretty good. but again, they're probably most likely subject to interpretation. and again, i think this goes back all the way to the original question about running events. if, if the event is run in such a way where the code of conduct, is put forth as a, a guideline that will be followed, like the expectation is is that, you know, myself or whoever's running the event, like won't tolerate any sort of like issues with a, a, conduct violation so absolutely if you want to if you want to put some examples in the run book that would be that would be great. i do think like i've personally never experienced a code of conduct violation. and, like, so if you wanted to like put like what they might look like in like a way that could be like subversive or, you know, not overt. that might be really helpful, because maybe there have been code of conduct violations that myself or, you know, other other attendees just haven't noticed, or aren't aware of. and i think, you know, again. no one's perfect i think that they haven't occurred, but having examples like that. like off the beaten path type of examples might be really helpful. but, but there have been no like, no, no overt like code of conduct violations in any of the meetings that i've ran so.

"," 26:54  
absolutely. this is, this has been my biggest challenge, i, i think, again, like with the engagement i've recruited some folks. and the. they come in they go, and i haven't been able to, like, build steady relationships with any other civically minded engaged folks in the phoenix area. so, a, an example has definitely limited. my brigade, and i think that is the number one issue that we're facing right now. it code for fans,

 27:29  
i think, yeah, put a six.

 27:49  
and, well, it's also a volunteering effort right so it's like, how did it. if you could solve the volunteering engagement issue. you could solve a lot of the problems in the world, because like coordinating volunteers that are skilled enough to do. you know, it's a different, it's a different volunteering effort right because i think that it could. i don't know this is a personal opinion but i code for america. like, we are looking like we're not building homes where everyone can like pound nails. we're actually like trying to organize information. right, and curate curate social and civic type of programs. and, you know, there might be even some technology. and i think that the volunteers. they're different. it's a different type of volunteering and i think that, you know, coordinating those individuals and keeping them engaged is sometimes, sometimes tough, especially when i say this but like some of the work isn't the most exciting. you know that a lot of the tech folks that i've engaged with they come in and they want to build some a portfolio project. and, you know, the work that really needs to get done is they need to create like an excel file, and they don't really think that is like an extra portfolio type project when they want to like build like a javascript application or something so how do you get those people engaged and then else also like the, the, the, the government types that are most likely, you know, a lot going on like how do you keep them coming back if they don't see kind of things that are happening to them. anyway, i'm kind of rambling but, well, the volunteer coordination and volunteer organization at code for america is is a challenge so and so and then leadership too i think that's, like, because i, the original question that you asked asked for was recruiting a leadership team right.

 29:52  
whatever. yeah, i think, in my head i kind of conflated the idea so, yes, absolutely it's it's it's definitely been one of the big challenges, especially i think i touched on this earlier, but i don't want the code for america or code for phoenix brigade to be you know tom marthaler i want to cook things brigade to be a separate entity. so, i'm still trying to build that core team so that it becomes that

 30:37  
oh yeah but if you give me a platform, i will just move on so that's good to know someone's listening,

"," 30:56  
uh, i think example could be useful. number three, i think this goes back to your kind of question about the government relationships as well like i think that strategically. you know sometimes like we kind of know what we want to work on. but we don't have a strategy right i don't necessarily have a strategy on taking that in like getting a monthly hacknight going to, to actually execute on that strategy so an example could be useful. number three,

"," 31:31  
a shoot i think i can fit it into a. i think that's very. let's say i will meet up i put a number for, i think, a getting an example in the future. we don't have any kind of current projects in the works. and so i think that right now we're at the brigade, or, you know, trying to trying to create that strategic strategic initiatives for the brigade. emily to kind of get those projects, kind of coming along. we will need an example. so, before

 32:07  
was no that's that's great i think i think it's definitely three so previous.

"," 32:17  
you know, we, i've. we. i don't know, 00, i don't know, um, we've never had an issue. i think with my community relationships and my technical relationships. everything we do technically we can get source, like a donated. so we've never had like a need. maybe this goes back to i think that when we do actually maybe have like a monthly hacknight, maybe we'll actually need to start doing actual legitimate fundraising. but it's weird how fundraising and partnerships, they're very similar, like i mean, it's weird bringing

 33:08  
what what's ahead unreasoning is relationships, everything is relationships and a lot of times but yeah so i think that, but i don't know, i think that i'm not aware of fundraising that i would need to do. i guess to to maybe support a monthly hacknight, especially. what i mean by that is, like, in the running of the brigade right so if you can get the space donated, if you can get like some, some refreshments donated. if you can get some, you know, technical cloud credits donated, like, what, what out like, i don't know what else there is, like, like what like we're not gonna like give people laptops to work on brigade initiatives, you know, so it's like those three things are usually the three things that i how i understand it maybe this is why the fundraising isn't really as important, but maybe it could be, depending on what this is what the output of this run book is is like hey you know get these things but but if you get some stuff donated like like the freshman's in the space, and the tech, like, i don't know i'm just kind of maybe unknowing about how people are spending their money. but, but i guess at the same time like the traveling, i think that i did, i did attend the, the brigade. the san francisco there was a brigade events, because 19, i forget the name of it but uh wasn't brigade congress what's the thing where they have all the people there in san francisco. before covid be pre covid anyway so there were scott they were sponsorships right and i didn't need one i was, i kind of shoehorned some other travel plans into, you know going to san francisco that week stayed with some family members there didn't really to fundraise didn't really need to actually spend much money, but that also at the same time as more of like the. that wasn't at the brigade level fundraising that was more at the code for america level. so, even then it's kind of hard it's kind of hard to differentiate sometimes about what money does a brigade really spent, what how do they spend their money. i, you know, we want to market stuff, because right now that code for phoenix is one of the major i think expenditures is the meetup page, like we actually the. it is a code for america funded meetup group. so they actually pay for the meetup directly from them so there isn't necessarily a expense there that i ever see. okay. yes. so,

unknown speaker  35:53  
it is important to figure,

 35:55  
the fundraising is definitely zero, and it's mainly, i don't know how brigade spend money.

 36:17  
they're paying people to go door to door or something. yeah,

"," 36:44  
we, you know, it's very interesting. maybe this is also related to fundraising. i've actually chosen to run our code for phoenix brigade on the code for america slack. using the code for phoenix channel and then also through phoenix brigade, captain, or the bigger thing that we have a private channel just for like the the core team. and so that's actually taken off of the slack issues, the github, you know, get up for teams is not free, like i don't think there's any expenditure there, like the, we, we have had no issues with any of the tooling ever provided i think that you know slack zoom, a meetup

 37:32  
think we've, there hasn't been a lot of like discourse like i know i know that like they're the, the discourse is at a level again at like the at the code for america level they use that to like disseminate like tom dinner i think was using really big in a discourse like like putting a bunch of information on the code for america discourse boards to like you know disseminate information and i know that you maybe the blp project is like using emails more and then there's some slack postings so i think that maybe discourse is still occurring, like maybe i just turned off the notifications or something but i don't know if it's as useful as it is, it has been or, because it was never really. i didn't log in to check discord every week. i do, i do see the code for america slack, all the time. so, i can follow up with that information so maybe that's just kind of personal operation, but tooling wise i that everything's on well, so i didn't give you a number, i think, i think, well, number two, so i say i don't need an example. the tools

 38:49  
i know if i, if i just start talking please please.

 39:01  
oh yeah, of course, go to the transcripts so well. because i honestly think that the numeric answers that i'm giving you. they're not important. yeah. what, what's going to be contained in the runbook. and i think that you what you don't point this meeting is like, i want the questions i have issues with to be explained in the render. and you may not get that information and a number. yes, other than oh we should spend more time on this topic. so,

 39:35  
oh wow, okay. i will go much faster i will, sorry, i will go much faster.

 39:52  
i will we will go i will go faster. so thank you for that.

"," 40:01  
an example could be useful. number three. okay.

"," 40:10  
i don't need an example number two.

"," 40:22  
geez, example could be useful in the future. so number four.

"," 40:36  
yeah, a. an example could be useful. so put put number three. okay, that's very interesting because like, you know, if you if you do a lot of collaboration and like your day job game for brigade coordination shouldn't be much different. maybe the tools are different but you know i think that an example could be useful. there could be covid or brigade specific things that yeah that makes sense.

"," 41:47  
i put five, i think that i wish i had an example yesterday. uh huh. you know, i think that dni efforts are very hard to quantify sometimes like been for me personally like i feel like it goes back to also the core team, like, i know what i need to do. sometimes it just doesn't work out the way that you'd hoped. so, recruiting, you know, diverse members to create an inclusive. you know brigade is definitely something on top, forefront of my mind. but, you know, i'm, i'm also looking for like a core team that will stick around, right. so, like,

 42:40  
right. yeah, so it's a, it's very interesting so but but five for that,

"," 42:53  
helping people with local job opportunities. so, the question was,

 43:02  
i would put a zero like i that's never really. yeah, put a zero i don't know where government in there is very interesting because like i don't know anyone that works for the government everyone i know that works in civic tech works for a contractor of some sort. so maybe that's the next question. so what's the. well,

"," 43:40  
um. ooh, i guess like is that is that the point of a brigade. to do that,

 44:08  
right. what i think in my regard like i think in my, i would, if someone came to brigade, asking about those things i would personally refer them to the right place like, i know that the library the phoenix level look a little iffy phoenix local library does a lot of that workforce development. so for me the answer to the question would be, i don't need an example like like number two, like i feel like that's not that's not in our charter. that's why i don't believe that's in our charter. to do that, so i can help with it like i feel like if there was a resume review event or something. help people how to get jobs but

 45:05  
okay, you can just type button, whatever. and.

 45:28  
i don't think like we don't do this well so we don't do this at all. i don't think it's a 01 or two, depending on how you want to,

"," 46:00  
yeah, i think the main thing was, you know, you had to recruit a core team. and i think that specifying the difference between setting up a hacknight versus the, you know, actual day of running of it. like, i i do think i need very specific help. like, maybe related to developing a core team, but creating an attending and find the right partners, which saw, they're all kind of really good so i don't think there's necessarily like any additional questions i just wish that for the things that you are developing like it's gonna be interesting to see how how deep and tech like deep those and uh you know run books will be. i will say like, you know, coordinating volunteer types. i think that might be a good thing to address, how do you how do you coordinate a volunteer that say does work for a local government institution, versus coordinating a volunteer that works for a contractor that wants to develop something to try to sell it to someone, i don't know what they do but they it's kind of a different thing or they look they volunteered. how do you coordinate different volunteer types, because i think that each one does bring something different and we need all of that. and how do you get the most out of those volunteers. so, does that make sense. so, okay, but other than that, like i think some other questions you asked her, were very good. i guess.

unknown speaker  47:45  
great.

 48:12  
versus even like like local like a local tech person working in tech. right, kind of come and volunteer. right. like, don't like like there and i'm sure that there's other pro volunteer profiles, if you will. right, put together like, well how do you this this person or this background most likely is looking to get this out of the brigade. this is how you can make make them effective and keep them engaged. i don't know if that's part of the runbook or if that's a

 48:47  
yeah. when you bring it up, maybe it'll share.

"," 50:17  
i am the brigade captain. awesome.

 50:42  
it's very interesting because it's like, how would you. you count like say a monthly member, but then someone that actually shows up every six months. i would say it's like one and a half. seriously, it's not a very big brigade. we don't remember

unknown speaker  50:58  
one is you. i mean,

 51:01  
and i'm trying to get some other people to kind of engage. so, but 1.5 1.5

 51:16  
that'd be like what 28. hey, i think that so here's, here's here's really what it comes down to is like when we do the national day events, like when we ran in 2019. there was a like, like 20, between 24 and 26 people at the event with like, you know, for three or four other people that weren't associated with the code for america event but they were participating they were there so i'm like it, but like from a regular brigade, they i don't know if they consider themselves part of the brigade. that's more of them volunteering for the national day

unknown speaker  51:55  
is a caveat,

 52:16  
yeah to about, probably two years, so i took over i think i could check, check, do an exact exact number. no, it

 52:34  
too well. i took it over and december 2018, so two.

 52:52  
i may have seen it i've never read it.

 52:59  
no, no, i've never done no, i've never seen it.

 53:13  
i, i take that back yes, i have seen it. i have seen, i have seen it, like, yeah, okay. it just seems very like kind of theoretical sometimes

 53:43  
other than say can't remember the last time. so, i think i have i've seen it, i think when someone sent it to me i looked at it briefly but i don't think i'd ever used it. okay. that's an answer.

 54:22  
i don't know, like, how would you answer this knowing i, i feel like it could be helpful if i was engaged with it. so i maybe put a three. just like a non answer it's not good. not bad. hopefully it averages out.

 54:49  
that that could be both. so, okay, what do you want to answer to three.

 55:17  
like a five.

unknown speaker  55:18  
okay,

 55:19  
i just i never, i would never not recommend it, but i would never like forcefully recommended either so just as he did not answer.

 55:55  
i would. yes, yes, but not. don't, don't, don't bother. i think

 56:03  
so, in the sense of like, i don't have any active members right. yeah, that's why i think that's what's very tough.

 56:57  
not that i can think of right now. i will say you were very accommodating with the time slot i think having the time at five o'clock.

 57:55  
you can do number two. i feel like that's good.

 58:00  
yeah talk about all i'll put my put the brigade next to all the answers. just don't put my name. i mean, i mean, not that i cared because i don't know where they end up so number two.

 58:41  
all right. and i think one of the things i was asking the very beginning, well, you may have, you may have, like, how are you going to define the success of the braid the brigade organizers playbook.

unknown speaker  58:57  
hmm.

 58:57  
are you going to continue. are you going to conduct these by annually. and if the numbers on those engagement with the playbook go up, you're going to say hey this is a successful initiative. or if somehow, if there's a successful thing that like maybe a brigade person does. they say referenced it or i do you have any, like, how are you going to define like you kind of see i'm saying like how are you going to say, yes, the playbook that we created was the right one.

 59:37  
okay. but i'd be great to know i think because, like, it's gonna be interesting. yeah,

 1:00:08  
yeah, it's hard, unless you're typing what you're saying.

 1:00:46  
if someone could refer back and say the reason that we did this thing was because of this, is that what there is that what you're looking for. okay, or, or is. is there gonna be some other measurement technique or should i be looking out for that after i start using that to like give you feedback, or, etc. so yeah and then the real question is how are you, how are you collecting feedback on the revisions that you're making. i think that the feedback in the success are maybe intertwined. but that's okay that's not there. that's not my. that's you. and the. the code for america folks to figure that out. so that's one kind of

 1:01:34  
that's great. and i think that if you, if you have this exact interview. next year, the numbers are going to change. and if they go up, you're gonna be like that's awesome. we went from 4.6 to 6.8 or something on the bop usefulness or something like that it's just an idea. so,

 1:02:16  
well, all right, well thank you i is this done we concluded or

 1:02:44  
likewise. okay. bye.

oh,

 3:07  
hi, ted. how do i how do i say your name, dan

 3:35  
oh, pretty good. my wife just reminded me you told me that there isn't a meeting at eight o'clock. so i was like, oh. so, yeah, everything is good going good so far. yeah, so just the same work schedules and stuff. yeah. oh,

 4:49  
should that should be about, that should be okay and they said the recording is for the purpose of transcribing right.

 6:48  
i sent you my email. yeah, thank

 7:01  
for the survey results.

unknown speaker  7:50  
well,

"," 11:11  
just.

 11:35  
so, i'm a little confused with the questions and stuff. mm hmm.

"," 13:26  
so when you say this example thing. uh huh. are you saying that example or model have been carrying out, like with the question itself like who would like to learn about your brigades need for an exam or model when carrying out a variety of activities and topics. what is the first part of the question, which is an example when you mean for an example, you would like to learn.

"," 15:12  
could be. yeah, i mean, yeah, definitely, it would be nice to see what other brigades are doing. i mean, we have our own way of approaching the gun partnership but now.

"," 15:54  
so, what is this i wish i had an example yesterday like you know we're trying.

"," 17:11  
other choices that are in that i'm not really allowed to define. okay, we can really exemplify, let's say, if it has been an example, or an example could be useful. we do this, but we still like to have an example. you know that could be a nice option that i could pick. you know, i mean, i don't see other choices relevant. i mean, at all something close to even the, the whole point is like you know you definitely want to know how others are doing. uh huh. that's. yes, but there is more to it like have you done that, yes, you know. so, i mean there is no other better option for me other than that.

"," 18:39  
in the middle of usage in software development right.

 18:47  
another of that. so what is the question once again.

 19:26  
okay, so i'll choose five fire. okay.

"," 19:50  
think i don't need an example for that.

"," 20:07  
never knew that example, an s

so kind of like when you say to explanation of the tools, or what is it.

yeah, i mean, definitely.

"," 24:00  
right. okay,

",," 25:01  
we diversity inclusion.

",," 25:55  
can you repeat the question.

 26:31  
did we cover the brigade leadership roles and i think we did right so we did cover the leadership roles and stuff, to me.

 26:45  
um, kind of like what roles does a prepared leader. i mean, brigade captain had to deal with, or, and what role should brigade liters daily weigh, you know, kind of like the disbursement of duties or something like

 27:09  
and just to see what others are doing. yeah.

 27:31  
it too much i think victoria was chosen. yeah.

"," 28:06  
yes,

 29:46  
yeah, i'll just try to put put together, whatever, you know,

 31:12  
writing it in a higher level. so if you think that needs much more further explanation, you can.

 32:21  
yeah.

 33:02  
only if i tried to get closer to what you were asking.

 33:45  
sure, that's okay. okay, thanks

 34:12  
i can start with the first one.

 35:14  
so, each project has to mean has a different, different set of tools that we use for one of the project, we use to github. uh huh. and, you know, orientation, and we used in one of them we even use google spreadsheet, and for another particular task we use trello. so, i mean, it project depends on what kind of project it is we try to go with particular, too.

 36:22  
we don't have any template or anything like that. we are the project in a new, fresh manner. okay.

 37:03  
we don't have it documented ahead of the project that's completely okay it while we are working on the process.

 37:32  
there are a few people who are especially good with this, so it goes folks to fit the documentation aspect of it.

 37:59  
we definitely ship.

unknown speaker  38:02  
welcome.

unknown speaker  38:04  
ship.

 38:17  
yeah. similarly, brought any project initiation template.

unknown speaker  38:27  
a nice

 38:46  
yes, it will be

 38:56  
yeah we got identifying the strengths and team members.

 39:12  
so, so identifying the strengths of team members and providing like you know we we have a diversified variety of skilled team members. and just by the type of their work, we happen to understand what they are really good at. so we try to direct them to do certain tasks or delegate them like certain tasks that they're really good at. so, identifying the strengths of each individual is a key, key to over project development. uh huh.

 40:52  
not really i guess because that's the identifying the stances within the team so i think we are good on that.

unknown speaker  40:58  
oh wow. okay.

unknown speaker  41:05  
so,

 41:52  
um, yeah. okay, so, every project will have several ways to achieve the same thing. so we want to encourage every team member to do individual research that will cue them the background information in a much more better way. and, and her and provide a meaningful discussion. when we have to decide on what route to take. so am i proud to do great. ah.

 42:50  
i guess in both stages, like when we are starting a new project when we know that we have a project finalized, we discuss, we put together the requirements. and now, we work on, how do we achieve that, like you know, that we do the brainstorming, for, for achieving this project, and sometimes there are some intricate details that we may have to discuss. and i believe, having an individual, each and every individual member do their due diligence to the whole project, or even a single task is what we encourage everybody so that you know, everybody is empowered and they, they know the crux of the project on what could be the direction, so we give equal opportunity for everyone's ideas.

unknown speaker  43:58  
okay.

 44:39  
yeah, i would appreciate any help in this. and we would like to see if there are any prior examples of other brigades have done this process, or what are some some relevant examples for us to take for steam spire from.

 45:20  
so, an existing project, not not trying to. so, we obtain the project. the obtaining the project part is clear. now once we have the project. now, what is the outcome like how do we achieve a certain outcome. so we try to do the research on how do we actually set a milestone. so, what are the number of ways to get to there. so we do the research, individual research, and then discuss and finalize the world, we'll take this route to achieve this milestone, or this project that order. aha.

 46:09  
i can give a quick example or a simple one,

 46:14  
we were doing a web site development we were doing website development for code for dallas. uh huh. we asked every individual team member to come with mock ups. so, for the markups or they use, they tried multiple varieties like some of them used google sites, others use. let's say there are plenty of off the shelf. you know, products that are available in the market. so they've tried to do some mock ups, and then they identify the advantages and disadvantages of each of these individual product or service that they're using. so, once they once, everybody did their part. and then we discuss the pros and cons of each of that. and then we start building on it on identifying the right product for us. does it make sense,

 47:30  
not the pieces of like, we basically get, let's say you, we have a project for website development and 10 of the numbers like hey, this is what we need to get to, for the website development. so, go do your research on developing a website like we got to pick the right resource, like when i mean to resource like sites. there, you know, there are plenty of website building tools right on the internet, internet, so we ask them to try each and everything we and we give them characteristics of what to be considered like pros and cons like, what is the price aspect of each limitations of each, what are what are the flexibility of doing collaborate to work on each of these, so we want to basically let anybody work on individual things. and we discuss at the end of it, like, you know, we gather gather together and see which words which doesn't work. you know what's the advantage, what is the disadvantage on, where do we start building, you know.

 49:23  
my role is pretty much. bringing projects, collaborating with the government partnership bringing the projects, identifying the team members who would be a right fit for this particular project and initiate the project is my role, and then we'll be taking off.

 49:55  
i said the rest of the rest of the team members will take the project to the next levels.

 50:07  
to 20 people.

 50:20  
i said we had a new brigade we are like less than a year old.

 51:25  
so, does this way to the rest of the team members to do the same, or what is it

 51:43  
i would say, i don't know if if this would be useful at this point. okay, give at least one more year for everybody to get acquainted.

 52:11  
yes, i can. canadian maybe check with them and they're okay comfortable doing this and then i can give you the heads up.

 52:41  
i will check with them and if they are comfortable going ahead with this process. then i'll definitely, communicate, communicate.

 53:59  
so this is like this data or this information will be not public but you know you can, you could aggregate that as part of your.

 54:36  
and would you not be able to do this same thing, like, by sending a survey to everybody.

 55:39  
sure,

 55:50  
nothing much. actually,

 56:10  
oh shoot. yeah.

hey, good afternoon, good morning. sit down.

 4:32  
good man. i think that's probably the best use phrase, these are most common use phrases i was on mute right in the zoom, zoom era. my name is dj. jay, nice

 4:58  
yeah, so i, i was just purely trying to save time for you guys because we have to, you know, we are. i'm a co captain and, yeah, i'm a captain and i have a co captain so i was just really trying to save time for you guys rather than having to schedule to interview separately, but seems like this might be the first time you guys are taking interview from two.

 5:35  
so

marianne miranda  5:38  
i'll just read. actually,

unknown speaker  5:42  
you so he. correct. actually he is so he's actually mentoring at a community event because osu ohio state university called hakko. so he should be jumping in.

unknown speaker  5:57  
there you go.

unknown speaker  6:01  
well,

 6:05  
a

 6:06  
fancy background bear ninjago wow,

 6:16  
my work team we did a virtual escape room together so this was like my one of my zoom backgrounds for it.

 6:25  
i don't you go down here on that. oh you did that with your team exercise. i'm planning a exercise but i'm not sure if there will be this like this amazing. what's your escape room, nice.

 6:35  
it's not free. but yeah, i can share that with you next one we might actually do that, i think it was the jigsaw explorer thing like people were posting in the cfa slack. we might do. okay, we might do that as a group, you know, solve the puzzle together. all right.

marianne miranda  6:59  
okay, so i'm actually okay so i'm gonna be like i already gave this little spiel to bj but this is our first time doing a more than one person on one call so i'll be here to kind of observe, as i'm the ux research team lead for this project. so i'm here to observe like the differences and i could also ask more questions, since i'm more in tune with the project, then the intro, then the interview were attached here, so i'll be muting myself.

 8:58  
yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

 9:08  
alright, you don't you don't assume right.

 9:43  
i apologize guys, my apologies.

 10:44  
right.

 11:15  
correct. yes, exactly. there's two open columbus one is indiana, ohio

"," 13:29  
i don't, i would say it's number two. i mean, what do you think.

 13:33  
yep, maybe, number two.

",," 14:10  
sorry, i would lean to two words number two as well me here, i don't know. i mean,

 14:17  
it's, it's difficult to say it because i think i did it two or three, three i think right yeah ends on the type of partnership and

 14:28  
because we define goldman men rightly so we work with like a city. we work with city but that's not a state government but it's a city partner. yeah. so what do we agree number three, i think, yeah, maybe

unknown speaker  14:43  
you like to see

 14:45  
the number. yeah, i think i will go three. all right. sorry daniel.

"," 15:09  
with a one pager is

 15:12  
yeah. okay. well,

"," 15:36  
i'm trying not to say so that i would not prompt your decision. this slab, keep dropping our opinions here you go first. anyone and we are very much alike in in our thinking. so, yeah, i feel comfortable. relying a lot that scary sometimes to

 15:57  
the school. that is, i don't think we need an example of it. we with our partnerships and like what the community we actually have a good pulse on how to get engaged volunteers. so, yeah, i would lead to. but what do you what your thoughts vj.

 16:18  
yep. remember do like a free play right you might have to choose another number nine.

"," 16:45  
yeah, why don't we, i think when we do have developers we do it well.

 16:51  
reported developers.

 17:17  
i have two kids. so,

unknown speaker  17:21  
i learned to mute myself.

unknown speaker  17:25  
sorry.

 17:27  
they can barge at any time by the way in your recording so be ready for that

"," 17:45  
think we could use some examples there.

 17:55  
bigger than two. um, i don't know if we need it, necessarily, but i think it'd be useful to, we could, it could be useful, because we've already with, with the other projects that we've done like we've had user testing and so depending on the scope and the area, i think we could be useful,

 18:14  
but it was very useful on the evaluation of the last activity with data in september. right. yeah, evaluating government projects already, as part of the national day of civic hacking. we absolutely know needed those ux guidelines are not ux but the guidelines to evaluate a project. so, yeah, number three i guess right.

 18:38  
yeah, i think three. okay, all right, i

"," 18:55  
i think it'd be useful to have an example for that one.

 18:59  
we have to do.

 19:01  
i think i'm think a four would be a good

 19:07  
or thought yes i

 19:08  
wish, it'd be a wish, you're gonna need

 19:16  
god. i, yeah, let's call it four. yeah.

 19:20  
i mean,

 19:21  
i'm pretty sure there are you know some literature that we probably never read. do i blame ourselves as well of not digging in advance. right. but not reaching other brigade members or co captains in different brigades. yeah.

"," 19:48  
yeah, i definitely think example would be useful here.

 19:53  
open to 123. yeah.

"," 20:12  
we're gonna ask help right. nothing at all you know it's getting go. have a good time you have no idea what we're doing. at the start of the project. yeah. just organically happened. the full honesty, to number three, are you want to.

 20:34  
um,

 20:36  
let's see what was good some history, you know, timeline perspective future or yesterday.

 20:42  
yeah, i think, i think we can do something strong i think for us, i think we need an example i don't think we could have an example but i think we need to be a little stronger.

 20:52  
everyone winging it so far. i mean

 20:54  
it's been working pretty well like the big but that works pretty well that's

"," 21:17  
so kind of my trouble with that is because these projects are so specific to our neighborhood and our community, that it's very hard for us. central yeah that's. yeah, and i don't want to, like always say yes to giving an example because then it puts the burden on the. yeah. code for america which may not be able to then always come up with an example. so, sorry, sorry. number.

 21:54  
so, of the projects we've done, i think. and it's very specific to our community but different aspects of it that probably been tackled by other other brigades so i think i'm going three, i could be useful but like a requirement are needed. yeah, right.

 22:13  
all right, symmetry. yep.

 22:21  
we're just doing twos and threes the whole time.

 22:24  
i don't do well does the will make a belga. yeah. the battle graph, when we get

"," 22:39  
oh man, absolutely. number four, or number three or four.

 22:44  
yeah, i would say four. yeah. very little fundraising.

 22:51  
so far we were lucky to get. yeah, in kind given all the things that we needed.

 22:58  
through our partnerships and networks. yeah.

"," 23:18  
oh, i think we do that well.

 23:19  
yeah, yeah, number one.

 23:21  
yeah.

"," 23:30  
yeah, yeah. definitely.

 23:43  
you know i feel like i feel like it has to be a 5% because i was looking actually for some information on brigade and i don't know like and, yeah, i mean i went through voip and maybe i didn't read it quite well. but, yeah,

 23:58  
it might be useful if we had like sneeze, then we could talk to you about the

 24:02  
smes yeah,

 24:03  
yeah.

 24:05  
sure yeah so

 24:06  
five, instead of examples like just having somebody might have that kind of knowledge, expertise that we can get guidance from.

 24:18  
actually there's a there's a. yeah, there is a huge section on voip on that. also, i think, but that's, yeah. yeah, when we took that but, you know, that's like basic that you have to do. but we need something advanced right like that's. oh yeah, actually. i don't know when it was updated but there is a section on brigade ng. sorry, interacting with press anyway. so number five

"," 24:55  
do you mean as a new brigade or onboarding like our new members

 24:58  
project or. yeah,

 25:08  
mascot question again.

 25:34  
i don't think we do alone. number. yeah, definitely. number four, and five. yeah, even six, like the the slight little the central brigade selection with the regional slack channels i think does help. and we've actually tried to have a cross, cross brigade, like meeting. and then, pre covid, covid kind of hidden kind of threw that wrench, but we can definitely use up there, like, we, we haven't done enough of it i think i don't think many of our members even are in the national guard for. yeah,

 26:11  
i would. yeah. i have a great a severe five foot six meter.

 26:17  
yeah. yeah.

 26:20  
you want to pick.

 26:26  
what's your stance on that one, because i think it does limit but like there's some of the projects, if the people eating are not involved in the national brigade slack. then, they don't have those resources available and it kind of kind of become the bottleneck.

"," 27:04  
yeah, yeah it's it's either two or three for me i was like, the, all the stuff we've done is replicable like we've made them very

 27:16  
flexible obstructed and

 27:18  
abstracted, so. but yeah, it wouldn't hurt first the future products that come out if we had examples. with our developers tend to come and go so can't expect them to be here for every project.

 27:43  
"," 27:48  
i mean, i think we do a good job of it but i think we could use some examples to how to be a little more effective, especially recently beginning it was like, our numbers were a lot higher than even the physical ones in person ones. now that kind of going down. yeah. example.

 28:11  
yeah so number three.

 28:23  
i was wondering if i'd be like tandem slowing you down with your questions.

"," 28:46  
and, yeah, definitely higher number.

 28:50  
yeah, i agree.

 28:54  
i'm definitely encouraging more female members in our community to come in.

 29:02  
yeah, definitely. i think,

 29:06  
or even people from non tech background right yeah yeah i've been diversity in general, but it's a big topic.

 29:15  
that's something we haven't actually really strive to

 29:17  
plan strategize.

 29:20  
yeah, i don't think any example is something we would need to for ideas. so,

unknown speaker  29:28  
what do you think

 29:32  
you know i was looking at voip real quick just to make sure that i can remember as i looked at it a long time. i wish i would have remembered what i use from it or not, but i feel like six on this. it might be a good. i don't see an example here on it. it is not showing in my quick search. yeah.

marianne miranda  29:53  
i don't think the topic is in the current.

 29:57  
yeah. so number six, please. yeah.

"," 30:11  
i don't think we do that. to be honest, at all. so,

 30:16  
we don't but there's other groups in columbus that do, though, like it's not like an area we need to fill, kind of, but it wouldn't hurt that. yes, right.

 30:31  
yeah. yeah. all right. so, number three.

 30:34  
yeah. number three.

"," 30:53  
yeah, i mean i think the example there would be good. like, a lot of our members are very green and they're feel that they're trying to get into. so we basically are a safe space for people to like, learn new skills and, you know, we foster development. so having the example i think would be good. so, i'm leaning towards four that one region.

 31:15  
yep. actually at some point i'm trying to see the balance that should code for america be doing this because there are people who are exploiting it so you don't want to do everything right i don't want to be everything i just want to be civic tech group, focusing on specific projects and stuff like that. so i don't see yeah i don't see how you know i can rate it in the numbers that to reflect that this should not be in my opinion part of code for america. i mean we. yeah, anyway. but yeah, okay, i don't know, number, number zero probably for me. okay.

 31:56  
that's a good call out though, because there are other groups here in columbus that are doing the same thing. other any given group so

 32:04  
i would rather refer their, right, and take it over to world war two gleyber yeah, yeah, integrate.

 32:14  
sure. yeah, let's do zero then.

unknown speaker  32:18  
all right.

"," 32:36  
take a quick scan of the bob. it's an extra year.

 32:40  
sorry. i should have given you a really. he's really on that.

 32:48  
i have it.

 33:04  
i think one thing i would want to mention that the infrastructure part i don't know, i'm talking specifically tech infrastructure. and for that, i mean, tom and you know, don d and all these people are super responsive. first of all, i just want to call it out. but that is one extra thing for tom to take care of when this can be automated in some way or added in someplace where it's, you know, even more. we're both where we can just go in, we can see okay so i need to do these steps to get that heroku sort of my platform to transfer over to code for america so that would have been simple rather than you know every time. tom has to tell us. so that's something i was wondering, could be, and i can totally understand the playbook should be short, but it could be a branch out from there, that if you need more information on that. see here. cool. there's a lot of. yeah. and even with the onboarding right last, last year when i was doing it. i felt like there was a tremendous amount of involvement that i had to had on a group that already exist, trying to be code for america brigade, i felt like right may have been going to those days i mean it was, it was nightmare because we were probably doing everything that your playbook says not to. we had our own slack doing you know have members with, you know, bodies that we were advised not to be like city some of the city contractors and yeah anyway, so. so yeah, we have to sit down our previous like and so if i summarize it what i'm trying to say is the playbook can be sort of have a section to onboard existing civic tech groups into code for america. i guess that's a really good place. yeah, it's geared towards yeah it's geared towards new

 35:11  
you. yeah. ours was very unique because there was an existing brigade here in columbus that then, like, was basically deactivated or stop. stop meeting. then, what eight months, nine months later, our vj and i picked it up and merged it with our existing

 35:33  
group, group yeah,

 35:35  
so it's a group so there was, it was kind of an interesting because like we were like you said doing everything that

 35:42  
name change right like we didn't have that open or code for, i mean we were something totally else.

 35:50  
yeah, and it was, it was a rough transition, while people were still trying to find out from the senior team to different group sites and stuff. lower for a good while.

 36:05  
i'm sorry, good

 36:25  
right, so that yeah the billing and all that can be handled by code for america right.

 36:41  
i'm sorry, do a quick search on here but i might be searching the wrong terms, but in the bop it. it seems like in this remote world we're doing a lot more, there's actually a lot more cross brigade collaboration. but nothing in there, like talks about doing something about how do you host a cross team event across brigade event, how do you how do you like build those relationships cultivate that kind of relationship. don't know if he did he think differently but i mean, i was just something i've noticed like, i need

 37:19  
a valid point.

 37:20  
yeah, with code for austin or open austin, i think, nina sweet actually went out and reached out to them specifically. so it was just on the fly that we do this,

 37:40  
yeah, we're just like if it's if it's part of the plane but like it sounds like this you specifically, the national code for america is promoting more cross city. cross brigade collaboration. so, to include that in there would be useful and i think last year when he went to target congress. it was great, like that was a great atmosphere in place to be, but uh after you left there was little like we collaborate across ohio and have those conversations going but it didn't seem like a lot of other chapters or brigades are doing the same thing. and now we're trying to promote that. it was just like, on the, on those two specific national day of civic hacking, this would happen, which was good but outside of that it didn't seem to happen at all last year. so maybe it's visibility thing, i don't know.

 38:39  
all right. got it. i was wondering mir, i don't know if that crosses your thought i was always hoping that code for america could have like a, you know, monthly or whatever the cadence is bi weekly newsletter coming out and of highlighting all the different things. so slack is, i mean i live in slack world whereas, it's a hyper fatigue over there, like it's just a lot going on. and we're says, i'm not a proponent for emails, but i'm just saying, in this instance to summarize things like what here is saying like, you know, awesome stuff happening in different brigade can be like one thing can we make into the national newsletter that basically is like an abstraction of all the goodness in one newsletter that you can actually follow and so i maybe there is i just never knew and, but i did try to see, but i couldn't find it easily.

 39:37  
yeah, that's also a good point like the, there's a lot of. i won't say it's honestly noise but there's a lot of activity in the national code for america slack. and we've seen that. yeah,

 39:50  
which is healthy. i mean, that's fine, that's that's a indication of a good healthy community. right.

 39:55  
and we see that in our in our local columbus like slack workspaces as well, but that does off, put people, and they need a different way to consume it and we have found newsletters weekly or monthly have like given them a nice condensed way of finding funding how they can help contribute or, you know, volunteer there's

 40:16  
yeah that that newsletter keeps the signal and the noises in the slack. but that has a signal. and in that you attract people and join. yeah,

 40:30  
we

 40:31  
are different. yeah, yeah, there's a dog vacated.

 40:34  
yeah.

 40:42  
guys. sure. yeah, absolutely. yeah.

 40:59  
sorry i'm and that lots got i got not specifically for bob, but, you know, maybe bob can just say, okay, there is a monthly subscription and our newsletter that you can subscribe here that will be handy if there is not

 41:23  
sorry i should have thought a little bit more about this, i think i'm sort of thinking about the donation right like me i mean we struggle on that, like how do you like we did a test as well but i actually that ball got dropped. so we actually have some like 150 dollars donated in our account but we don't think we ever sort of went and try to take out that for our purposes, variable.

 41:51  
yeah, because we put it in and then cold they happen.

 41:57  
well i donated 150 dollars to code for america. that's good. but i don't know how to take it back to do some of our expenses that i thought we could, we were just doing a trial to put some money in code for america account and then we should be able to then take it out. i mean it's actually in our account sorry, open columbus, ohio, brigade account but it just like we never knew how to take it out and that was another churn, i still, you know, that kind of ball drop there. but i feel like bo p doesn't, in my opinion, did a pretty good job on how to handle the finance aspect. so how do you you know give this to our partners so you know company in ohio technologies, how would they know to give a donation to vote for columbus. then open pick open columbus from the drop down it's like a lot of steps for them to actually route money to my brigade. and that's where they lose interest in my opinion as well. they don't want to give something to a national entity, rather than you know if that would be a specific finance page for open columbus, ohio, that would be low barrier for them to give donation.

 43:10  
yeah. yeah, that's a good point that that did actually come up is especially because for us specifically there's two open columbus's. so,

 43:23  
i don't want to give my. yeah, even more i don't think there was

 43:30  
one other thing i wanted to mention, i think it was on the national days of hacking, on, on the spreadsheet or some of the documentation we were still called code for columbus. so, i don't, i don't know what we missed in our onboarding. but, there seemed to be someplace that still referred to us as code for columbus. yeah.

 44:03  
and i can't think no it was one of my in the onboarding process like you know like the stuff ej mentioned the beginning if we can make sure we include how to update all the messy documentation. alright. do you think it was on the drop down for when you choose in yours, it was code for columbus.

 44:24  
even the website right like i guess the code for america website which then has brigades, it took a while to get that updated as well. with the right name.

 44:42  
i think that's unique to us because we are an

 44:45  
eight and has kind of like a black swan event but i mean brigade can decide to change their name and then probably this can happen. yeah.

 45:13  
what was that question. i think we're getting the last question if this was a question. no. yeah, i

 45:30  
i think so no i can't think of anything else.

 45:32  
yep.

 45:46  
so,

marianne miranda  45:47  
um, i think the next, the next question is like if they have processes and practices right. yep. okay, so i think we should kind of, like, take the time to do that. whatever your process is that y'all have.

 46:04  
yeah, putting on putting you on the spot here but yeah i have a newsletter if you want to show. now you know the background. yes. cool.

"," 47:03  
yeah. so like, you know, i think the. i was wondering what could be addressed as unique, in order to see the time as well. like, you know basic stuff is pretty normal in our process right like that everybody's probably doing so i was just wondering like what was makes us, what do you think me here is like

 47:24  
recurring, we have recurring meetup events so like we don't we don't create a meetup every month. we have monthly recurring ones.

 47:32  
i mean, yeah, so meetup meetup.

 47:37  
yeah. shortlinks that we have for like, so he for example we have a monthly like brigade meetup and then we have a like just a show and tell of sorts. and we have a monthly mapping mapathon event, and then we try to do a monthly hackathon, not down, but for each of these we actually have like short links. so, like, for example, was it open columbus dot mapping. open commerce. comm slash mapping or something like that, so they could quickly get to the meetup event. so we wouldn't have to create the meetup event itself but we would have to manually just update those links to point to the new location that just made it easier to share out with people so it's a fixed link, they have to go to and not someplace else so that i think that was useful. around the newsletter, we don't actually do it for the open columbus brigade but we are partnered with another columbus civic tech group here that sends a weekly newsletter out, and i'm one of the organizers for that one as well. so on that one. it's basically a week weekly newsletter we send out we basically curate like what projects to highlight what projects are launching what what's like a new, new event coming up next week that we can, can send out, and then other things in the community, going on like covid related news information, highlighting specific individuals or teams. so those are the things we kind of showcase there, and then there's another group in columbus that started like 20 years ago that has a tie people and so they have a newsletter that comes out every weekly and weekly and we put. we have a small section reserved in their newsletter for our for highlighting one more project so like working with local newsletters, like people are sending out newsletters is how we've gotten the word out for some of our projects. so, yeah, the open climates itself doesn't have a specific newsletter that goes out every week but these other organizations not like civic community groups do until we've plugged into their networks.

 50:00  
yeah, as to why reinvent the wheel. these they're already reaching the same people that we're probably going to reach into, because one of them has over 8000 subscription members and the other one has over 2000 so it's like. overall though there's probably a good chunk of overlap.

 50:17  
and that's the key point right like what is open columbus, we are expanding open columbus from different niche, i mean these are same people who are involved. you know, we, she's not a co captain but i i was trying to involve her into co captains here but she never opted in but there's another very active community member, she kind of overlaps between the two. and she's very activated. she actually active more than me and i on code for america.

 50:44  
recently

 50:45  
she tags us there. yeah, but she's not part of i mean she's our. she's a group member open columbus member but she also is very active and different other places within the community and gone stop columbus is one of that, you know, event that happened during our legal video period that basically mobilized the whole community here in columbus, and a lot of people in open columbus and. and then this concept columbus overlaps.

 51:48  
well i can tell you now, we haven't documented this anywhere yet it's fine. so dsm a google doc or anything so i just, i must be j you

 52:02  
know and that's something we should then write like because. yeah, because i think we. yeah, i mean some of that is just like, yeah, we need to do that for future co captains, right, or when we pass the baton on the way because even for our group is important we haven't thought that far. we should be. but, by making main events. what i meant is we have a monthly event in which is all hands on projects coming in and doing their process, doing their progress report and and that's where it's very open to everyone to join in. but then we have these specific project related cadence as well, in a month. and, and that's very specific to that project and and that also open to everyone but but you will be very focused in that versus the other one is like one plus one which we encourage and market more is for anyone to just jump in, even though they are not part of any project. so that's the definition of main versus.

 53:10  
yeah, it's a good, good opportunity for a lot of people that just want to get involved and don't know how to get an update on all the projects that are happening and then, which, which one they want to get involved with because.

 53:23  
and having something like that is very important in our opinion, because that kind of forces people to do. do not just like branch off and. and then, like, not report, or have some sort of oversight that,

 53:38  
yeah. yeah, it's not siloed into one corner, and actually has helped out because it's actually two of our projects that now might be able to cross like collaborate because they're both working on specific problems but it's in a similar similar space. so that could be an opportunity for them to like have some pipe that's connected.

 53:58  
i think we're running it rating wise sorry. okay, so rating wise i would say

 54:26  
you know, i think it just us for this one like how to organize these things that i mentioned here. these are more like, in my opinion, metadata that we need to write our own, and then publish it, i mean yes i mean somebody can review it or we can take somebody else's. you know, playbook as specific playbook as guideline but i feel like that just us it's just,

 54:52  
i think it's, um, this is carfare monwy but my priority is not documenting it's more making sure it's moving. exactly. when i have free time it's focused on that and not like let's organizer tasks.

 55:10  
yeah, i don't, you know, kind of happy with not documenting it because it moving. and the documentation changes right like that's another burden that but we still can document enough, that, that helps the future and which we did right like accounts and all so we have a, you know, organizer sheet where we have all the accounts all the contacts that we have listed out, and stuff like that so we have like one document that we all organizers play with.

 55:50  
you guys using you mentioned there's a sheet. so yeah we heavily use google drive and all things. yeah.

 56:03  
right now,

 56:07  
yeah man, absolutely.

 56:08  
yeah, right. yeah, it was kind of, we kind of structured to with like some of the events we take pictures and we would store those in certain folders and directories because they're good marketing tools right we could show it off later. so it was kind of trying to keep everything in drive so that one person has it on their machine. and then, same with our slide decks like we have a template we use for slide decks that we actually got from code for toronto, it was. oh wow. yeah, so.

 56:45  
shirt. the point is, should i add someone. i mean, i have to like what email address, should i use to. oh,

 57:27  
for using a fixed url.

 57:30  
yeah it's it's it's not documented. okay. so,

 57:56  
i'm setting it up isn't now, it's just happened to conversation curating the actual date like what content is not documented is just people asking it's just people private that's providing different groups and projects for what's happening. this next week. so, not documented either, so.

 58:27  
the, i would write the last topic as evangelization which i forgot to add earlier so yeah i mean me here and i had taken that role in last one year, sort of like also to keep evangelizing open columbus so we were does that mean so like we have communicated with our media partners here in columbus, so finding that was very important so like we reached out to sort of media partners here and they were interested in some of the projects that we are doing. we got through one of our project we did got like good media coverage and our group got some media coverage so that was very positive and i believe that's another thing. good for other code for america advocates can definitely use.

 59:25  
late, people.

marianne miranda  59:28  
and don't worry, also like are you open for us to kind of reach out to like if you want to elaborate more on these. okay. absolutely. great. yeah, because there's a section and then we have another meeting after this.

 59:45  
okay, please. okay.

 1:00:10  
so i'm captain and i'm the area's co captain

 1:00:29  
i mean it like

 1:00:35  
i mean, they're on our meetup there are like almost 800 plus members last i checked out. actually, we are close to thousand, but active, i would say that's the word right so mere 30 or 2530.

 1:00:48  
yes, around there.

 1:00:49  
i think that's okay.

 1:01:03  
we've been managing this since we're since we are a brigade. but, i guess. in total, it's been years been happier, a year really code for america.

 1:01:18  
yeah.

 1:01:29  
yes. okay.

 1:01:41  
i would say not monthly is there are three monthly.

 1:01:52  
yeah, i was, i would say treeman because i don't think i event every month to look, but i, i, yeah it's linked in our in our drive and, you know, that's where we go when we don't know what we are doing.

 1:02:22  
i would rate five.

 1:02:28  
yeah, i mean, going, going through, i. to be honest i don't go through it that often. yeah, going through this morning actually this this definitely some helpful links that i probably should have looked at before i did things on my own.

 1:02:55  
it's a good resource i think so. i think i'm like, it's like later on, like my number. yeah.

 1:03:01  
yeah. like not yeah, eight, eight, you said one to 10 right. yeah. yep.

 1:03:40  
sure. i mean, yeah, we can definitely become members, i mean we have a core group of people beyond us as well and yeah perspective from them would be pretty good. there should be given a name or we can

unknown speaker  1:03:53  
fire. yeah, yeah.

 1:03:55  
i don't know if any of them. so, we can we can share that up. i don't know if any of them actually seen the bop

marianne miranda  1:04:02  
in it's currently don't they also don't need to. the main goal of kind of like this interview, to understand like the needs, like in general, but so it's like not just the bot but maybe like any other thing that code for america could provide or do.

unknown speaker  1:04:19  
gotcha.

 1:04:23  
and beginner friendly, find someone who would be willing to do yeah

marianne miranda  1:04:27  
and i'll probably send the email like sometime like two days to kind of also follow up with the processes and practices because we're kind of like out of time right now. no, please, please,

 1:04:36  
sorry. yeah, go ahead.

marianne miranda  1:04:38  
i think we should go to the how public. yeah, this question. and also, transparency, i am the one who's like transcript, i'm going to transcribe this interview, and so like,

 1:04:53  
oh yes yeah yeah i don't have any issues for public. that's okay for me. yeah.

 1:05:04  
yep, wonderful question quickly for the stupors for the person we find that it's for you guys to interview is that can be an hour time slot for them or 25 minutes, what is the expectation

marianne miranda  1:05:14  
yeah so we like have it set on calendly as 60 minute time slot. it really depends on how much like people have to offer and i already kind of guessed that, like with two people there's definitely, it will take a bit longer. so like yeah it really depends like i've had an interview code from 25 minutes, and then an interview go like an hour and eight minutes. so it really depends. no i

 1:05:37  
yeah i feel like i'm thinking of some people in my head right now they, they are talkers, they love to talk about open columbus and you know how their journey been evan they were with us before we became an open columbus so they have a lot to add to.

 1:05:57  
yeah,

 1:06:04  
thank you.

marianne miranda  1:06:04  
yeah, i'll reach out, like

 1:06:16  
you yeah, thank you for the questions and adjusting to the format. see

 11:23  
probably a three.


 11:37  
i'll think of it as like, i'm pretty good at the partnerships, but it's not institutionalized in my brigade. so i'll do three.


21:25  
um,


 21:27  
yeah, i think that, like,


21:31  
i


 21:32  
first got involved with the brigades in like 2012. and we had some more resources around that. and i guess that doesn't feel quite as important as the other ones like it. it seems like, in some instances that could have been developed further. but what i've seen from doing this over the years is just that, like, in a lot of cases, the government partnerships aren't worth the time to cultivate. and so that's kind of where that comes in. where i'm like, yeah, it definitely could have been helpful. but it's not the key pain point. yeah. so maybe that's more of a three now that i'm talking about it.




","11:53  
a


 11:55  
five,


 22:35  
that would just be immediately useful. because we have and i have like developed relationships with organizations


22:53  
that


 22:55  
could benefit from something like that. it's like an immediate kind of like, oh, they would, they would learn a lot. yeah, but we don't have. there's no one in our brigade who works on like, user research or anything who has that drive to develop a curriculum, like it's just different skill sets. but if a curriculum existed, and there are resources around it, so that we could just kind of out of the box, do something like that? i think it could be really helpful. and, and also, i think maybe one area that's missing from some of this is like, the advocacy and like evangelism part. yeah. like, how do you talk with elected representatives? how do you? what kind of resources do you share when you have the ear of someone who is, you know, even if they're fairly like, low level staffer, or if they're an elected official? we don't have i don't know that this would be part of the playbook. or if it would be like, here's five things that i've shared, like talking with elected officials, there's like books, articles, things like that, to get them to understand what user centered design is to get them to understand like how the procurement process could work. that's something that i have started to do a bit of, and i think it would be like we can up our impact if we're able to do more in that realm.


unknown speaker  11:57  
by "," 24:45  
yeah, i mean, i think the we have people who come in who know how to develop in that in that way, but they only have one piece of the puzzle. and we are really short on project manager. are like people who see all of the pieces that go into software development. and so there's like, a really kind of a missing piece there of we've got the person who knows they're part of that process. and then they're looking to me or others to like, understand how that works. i'm like, i don't know how that works. and so i think we tend to kind of have these, like, half baked kind of development practices that don't have are limited by not having someone who really understands it. yeah.


12:06  
or maybe six.


"," 12:18  
between five or six.


 12:29  
well, i think


 12:37  
we have like some pretty good ux people in our brigade.


12:45  
but


 12:46  
we don't really have the resources, like they don't have the capacity or interest to like train others. and that seems like kind of a nice, like, low lift thing that we could be doing. so, um, i would say like, probably five.


"," 13:26  
um, oh, put that as. in my case, when i've had violations, i've gotten a lot of support from code for america. but not necessarily like through any written documentation. like it's not part of the handbook or anything, and i think that would be really helpful. so in some ways, i'm like, we have had examples and trainings that i have attended. but i would say i would say number six, if i'm looking at like the whole brigade thing, i think we've had violations that we didn't have. it would it would have been really helpful in the past.


unknown speaker  14:12  
yeah.


"," 14:18  
of six.


","14:26  
six


 14:28  
or five.


 14:31  
i want to do that.


"," 14:41  
i'm


14:47  
for


unknown speaker  14:50  
okay, "," 14:57  
probably like


 15:00  
three,


"," 15:12  
would that be like the tools themselves? they're like guides on how to use them?


 15:25  
right? um, i think three,


"," 15:46  
i think two on the


15:51  
although maybe,


 15:54  
let's do three, i could see that maybe being useful with the right people.


"," 16:13  
like a five.


","16:23  
oh.


 16:33  
three,


"," 16:44  
only four?


 16:46  
or maybe like,


 16:48  
somewhere between four and five? because like we can use it right now. like today, not future yesterday, but


16:55  
maybe five, five?


"," 17:04  
a six.


 25:53  
yeah, and i think it's like, i would want to take that out of some of the corporate realm, like, it's, i would like to see how brigades have succeeded there and really more about like, bringing, it's a part of it is bringing people in, but the bigger part is keeping them. yeah, and in a place like portland, like, we have a pretty strong immigrant community.


unknown speaker  26:30  
which


 26:32  
kind of makeup a lot of the people of color in our communities, we are pretty white state. but there's, it's like, i wouldn't want it to just be a numbers game, i'd want it to be like, okay, like i can, we can make these really concerted efforts at bringing people in and like partnering with the right groups. and i'd love like a list of like, good examples of places to work with there, or like, common pain points that community groups have that we could go towards. and i want to like, as we're inviting them in making sure that the place we're inviting them into is something that a lot of people can engage in, and like feel welcomed. because i know that we have like, a lot of work to do there. it's like definitely geared towards technical people. we do an okay job of like, communicating asynchronously, and not letting too many loud voices dominate. but i think there's a lot more to do. so i would like resources that are kind of like, i think we could set the goals, but it's more about like, creating the space to meet them and do it long term, and maybe even like, having more of a challenge there. for each brigade to like, expect people to try harder.


"," 17:24  
i say two. i don't think that's necessarily because we do it well, but i think there are other groups that do that better. or that we?


",," 18:14  
i think like maybe getting more specific around volunteer management, and team structures. so not just growing a core team, but like really specific examples of volunteer, like how people welcome and retain volunteers. maybe sample texts or things that brigades use to like create a value statement or create a similar to like code of conduct, but like the other documents in there, like, this is what we work on. this is how we work. yeah, i think there could also be i've been thinking about, like how we could do more teaching and like different project models. so like some projects being really official like, this has a community partner and it has, you know, core team that's got a strategic plan. like there are those type of projects and then there are ones that we so often like don't have enough people to create a core team at the outset. so it's like we've got like one developer who's interested and works in like one type of coding language and it's like hard to match people. and so we end up having these like, little projects that maybe could branch into something more official someday. but really, they're kind of there just to like, give the person something to work on. and i think it's like from a couple different points of view, it'd be helpful to see if other brigades have a tactic like that. that's like more a project for like, learning than it is about impact. and maybe the impact is in the learning and the teaching and stuff like that. but yeah, i guess like different project models.


 21:01  
yeah. did you have them written down? which ones? those were?


","28:15
gonna go with no, no. 


 29:02  
so i'm brigade captain, like the public facing leader of the group, and then there's another captain who's more like internal kind of does more of the logistics and coordination.


 29:33  
let's say like 20 or 25. mm hmm.


 29:47  
probably like, two years, two years. but the only change is that the co-captain change, but i've been doing this since for four years. okay.


 30:10  
not really. i think i've i remember the first iterations like back in 2012. but i haven't really used the other resources since then.


 31:05  
um, yeah, i could see if my co captain will be interested in participating.


 31:18  
uh, it's probably fine. if you were to reach out, i can put her


unknown speaker  31:29  
okay.


 31:46  
i guess one other thing that comes to mind is like, resources on leadership transition. i think we've talked a little bit about


developing a core team. and that's pretty key to that. but a definitely i'm kind of thinking more about how to maybe that is just developing the core team, but wanting to kind of hand over the reins?


 32:36  
is this i guess, what type of format would this be? would this be like a bob report type of thing? or?


 33:14  
does it show like each response?


unknown speaker  33:18  
so


 33:39  
cool. um, yeah, i think that it's fine to do. partially public. okay.


unknown speaker  33:54  
yeah, and


 34:27  
thank you so much. thanks for being read on time. that's great.


unknown speaker  34:34  
okay, i",em (open maine),,003_openmaine_2020-11-19_Em-Burnett.txt
0," 8:03  
good how are you, i'm here,

 8:14  
nice to see someone else from the hyperbolic half roll a brigade. i've spoken with bonnie a few times.

 11:18  
i'm trying to think, i don't have access to my code for orlando email at the moment, but i'll give you

unknown speaker  11:27  
an alternative.

unknown speaker  11:40  
okay, so just a little taco. huh.

 12:00  
okay. by the way your voice is kind of reverberating. i, i don't know if it's me, or if that's a zoom thing.

 12:34  
e m that is the correct spelling.

 12:55  
okay, now you sound better by the way.

 13:58  
what was the last part you're cutting out again.

 14:42  
sounds good. and i'm responding in the chat as well jets.

"," 15:05  
personally,

i would give it a two, but for other. perhaps my co host or my co captain would probably like that so that's a difficult question to respond as myself, but as our representative the brigade. i would probably have to say three then.

 15:50  
yeah. okay. then, i would change it to three then you can set. i'm going to try to consider my co captains feelings as well as, instead of just my own perspective.

"," 16:33  
this past september, um, can you give a little bit more context to like do you mean like for future events or is just like this

",,,,," 18:24  
cuz we all do a lot of that. i'm

awesome with our partner so

"," 18:52  
um, we do have a code of conduct and we've had instances, but we've been pretty on top of documenting that for our for our brigade.

",," 19:51  
like we have on it's just actually following. it's kind of hard when it's just two people. mmm hmm.

unknown speaker  20:01  
i'd say.

 20:04  
sure, we'll say five. i'm going to speak for axle.

",," 20:19  
i know there are some topics that are already in the current brigade handbook, but it's mostly like a checklist. it's very, very simple.

 20:41  
and that's more of me finding out about the handbook on my own. it's just digging through the cfa website and the brigade website.

"," 21:21  
again, i know i'm where they exist on the site. uh, i don't think my co captain is aware. i don't think he really bears, it's just me, informing him yeah this exists. we'll try to figure out how we can get access to this, that doesn't really, there's no information on that other than. oh, just email this person, and then you're waiting

"," 21:56  
again, that's, that's my specialty so i don't need example but again for feature.

unknown speaker  22:08  
i'll put it for.

 22:28  
again, but it's not a priority.

um, right now we're going for

a high priority, low hanging fruit, right now.

"," 22:57  
so, so, like the one that

tfa provides already.

captain onboarding or just onboarding volunteers in general,

"," 23:52  
probably four.

i know on discord, there's a list of project frameworks and there have been some resources. but again, i'm speaking for another person so.

",," 24:57  
you know what, i'll just put three.

"," 25:14  
it's low, it's low on the list like we do a pretty decent job it's just people actually taking initiative to get those opportunities like here it goes. you gotta do the work on your end two

"," 25:45  
that's. we do that personally but

i'm just gonna keep saying all the examples of examples.

"," 26:10  
um, so you already covered partnerships you've covered meeting, organizing, you've covered fundraising.

you've covered a bleep project management.

 26:40  
okay, and he talks about user testing.

unknown speaker  26:44  
um,

 26:49  
yeah guys, sorry, go ahead.

 27:02  
oh, i think, i think, a topic that would be good, is just getting people to understand what civic technology is.

 27:20  
i would probably say five.

because it's, it's easier to explain to people or who are familiar in the like the tech industry. but if we're working with nonprofits or joe schmo are like residents to them, they just say to us free services they don't see it as something that is sustainable or helping make the community better. it's just a foreign topic to them.

 28:19  
yeah, throw in project management in there, um,

 28:35  
volunteer guess their own volunteer recruitment i know you have onboarding on there but that onboarding is separate from recruiting. yep. um,

so recruitment and retention.

oh and i guess.

do you have strategy yeah you already had strategy on there, those strategic planning.

i guess strategic planning for projects to like, what, what are the possible end goals for projects like what are the possible. um, i guess, outcomes for, like, so you you've delivered your your product, it tended off. hopefully, and that's it like, what, where do you go from there. like whose name is attached who i got. yeah. how long is it one year is it five years, what's. yeah, if that makes sense.

 30:41  
developing stronger connections with the brigade network because more, it's usually you somehow fall into it and you like the only way to get, i guess, a minor connection, or at least taking the first step is slack, but there's so much noise and i can understand why that's intimidating for people who are new, because they're so used to the slack from their local brigade. yeah, so i guess, making a stronger connection and getting deeper into the brigade network and code for america as a whole.

"," 33:16  
yes. so a list of just so i understand a list of, i guess, practices, or processes or processes that i believe we've done successfully, and that we'd like to share.

 34:31  
like documentation.

unknown speaker  35:07  
now on.

 36:39  
yes. i'm sitting, so she's lost, see. wow. all right.

she parks, everything.

unknown speaker  37:02  
are we good. yeah, we're good.

 37:36  
agendas go, or for anything in general.

 37:46  
oh, um, it's all it's on github. so, technically, it's a document.

 38:22  
if the brigade knows how to copy and paste, then sure i would say 2.5.

 38:45  
they don't really someone to walk through. if they know how to read. um, okay. it's simple, so i guess maybe maybe it's a four yeah, i would say fourth.

unknown speaker  39:00  
cool.

 39:25  
can you repeat that.

 39:44  
probably pure view because i we base it off of our brigade, so i'd like to hear

other

unknown speaker  39:57  
feedback. cool.

 40:34  
a off the top of my head i can think it be in our kit hub. okay.

if not then it'd be in our

leadership drive. um, but if you need the if you need the link i can get that to you.

unknown speaker  40:53  
um,

 41:11  
i don't want to take up your time like me trying to find him like, oh, where is it.

 41:52  
it's more of a.

how we do stuff i guess for the brigade itself. just very basic simple things we have like a, like an outline, like we created a sidebar that served as our outline. originally we had issues but then we turn those into. yeah, an outline. and then, well pages from there.

 42:34  
this would be to 2.5 this straight up 2.5. if it's the same.

 42:58  
this is github.

 43:13  
yeah, i guess you'd say tax it's literally the wiki section of.

 43:58  
i guess we would need help, packaging it

unknown speaker  44:04  
all kind of help.

unknown speaker  44:07  
i guess

 44:10  
formally like going through the steps that we took

to like making it official.

unknown speaker  44:21  
um,

 44:25  
i sorry i i can't really think no

 44:57  
for lucky.

oh, pass me thank you i pinned it to our github.

unknown speaker  45:09  
nice. yes, there.

 45:32  
oh, i like that. yeah, that's our slack based. uh, so i'm sorry, i'm reading this one okay. ah,

i guess, or, um, i mean, there's a, we already have a section in it for it, it's in our wiki.

unknown speaker  46:06  
so,

 46:12  
yeah, it's under brigade buddies but again like

unknown speaker  46:16  
it might need.

 46:20  
i don't know it would need some feedback from other brigades

 46:29  
so, i would, i would just say four because we already have it here.

 46:58  
it's more of a, they would need to set it up so there's no formal proper like explanation of how to set it up, it's just this is how it works. i'm more for the end user actually now that i think about it.

unknown speaker  47:14  
cool.

 47:28  
so, i guess like there could be a section there, how to set up donuts. um, then how to make buddies, so it's official. okay.

 47:58  
yes, the valhalla for retired captains. yes, our former captain, or two captains go. aaron, uh, she kind of dubbed it so it's caught on.

unknown speaker  48:16  
so it's, i would say.

 48:23  
it's not documented at all.

 48:39  
right. so, in, like, our strategy plan, when there's a section that says like who's part of, you know, your core team and whoever else like when you're structuring your brigade. it's mentioned under there so i guess it's known, but we do make a point to explaining

who the advisory board

unknown speaker  49:09  
is to people.

unknown speaker  49:14  
also,

 49:17  
we sort of informally have exit interviews, or our happens. it was just like one or two technically. and we tell them like we asked do you want to be a part of this advisory board, where even though you're not, you know, active in the brigade, as you used to be, you're still, you still have a foot still in the brigade, and you're welcome to come and provide, you know, insights and still stay up to date with us. and so far, so good. um, they stay within the leadership channel so they're still. they don't have overwhelming power, but they're there to, you know, jump in, when they want to.

 50:49  
can you clarify q&a.

 51:13  
i guess maybe probably formatting maybe. yeah. um, cuz for a second i was like is that quality assurance. hmm.

unknown speaker  51:25  
okay. yeah,

 51:40  
300 sorry, go ahead, um, where can they find

 52:17  
that response might change because i'm like, i do have a slide from the onboarding or the quickstart guide. but i just never published it. i just like removed it. i can always add it in.

 52:38  
oh, it's for new volunteers.

unknown speaker  52:41  
okay,

 52:55  
oh, i forgot about that process. yeah, it's a new process that could be shared.

 53:10  
really quick start guide but sure

it's a lot more appealing then. oh, you're it's onboarding orientation.

 53:44  
we have a trello.

 53:52  
it's not really a spreadsheet, um, it's more combine. but, yeah,

 54:12  
um, probably feedback. paired peer review. yeah.

 54:28  
next up i have to find the link.

 55:16  
here's an example from nationalism cocking 2019.

yay, pass me, i did a read me good jobs.

unknown speaker  55:45  
what was that,

 55:46  
oh no, i'm just congratulating myself or pass off, i'm like looking i'm like oh i did do that.

 56:10  
yeah, let me find that. so, so we send this out. should i just read it first and then i'll give an explanation

 56:34  
i guess for this one. how was this process.

unknown speaker  56:41  
um,

 56:50  
i want to say two because we have, i have a i created a template. um, slide deck, and then i used that for the volunteer orientation or volunteer slide deck. um,

so i don't know how well it would be used.

 57:33  
sure. probably formatting then, um,

unknown speaker  57:42  
and

 57:44  
i don't have access to the actual template.

because i don't have access to my email right now, but this is the result from that.

 58:26  
not built they'll probably come to me after this.

 58:38  
you i directly contact you 10, or.

 59:53  
my official title is a co captain

 1:00:10  
probably seven

 1:00:23  
on early. in november, tomorrow. so, around

april, may, but

according to the mru probably a month ago.

 1:00:49  
since april. so,

unknown speaker  1:00:54  
i think.

 1:01:20  
probably monthly, but not often is when we were transitioning, and i read it fully. and that's how i found out. oh, haptens new captains actually get an onboarding orientation. and you don't find that out until you read deeply into it.

 1:01:53  
oh yeah and you get access to resources funded by code for america. like there's stuff in it like it's documented. it's just unclear, and you have to dig for it.

 1:02:49  
i'd say it's for certain things, three, four. i'll go with the four it's been helpful, um, when needed.

but for certain things.

 1:03:21  
read, read before me or go see three before me. that's how i

ideally would operate,

where people actually look to other sources first as something already exists. yeah.

unknown speaker  1:03:45  
but that's not always the case.

 1:04:28  
based on my experience with my brigade. they're not fans of surveys, even though it be extremely valuable.

so if there's any way to gamify

this questionnaire or survey or.

or some incentive.

 1:04:56  
if that helps. unfortunately, it takes a lot to motivate them.

 1:05:06  
they don't like. you can take off the record i think

 1:05:45  
tested, like it's worth giving it a shot. no.

 1:06:34  
i will put his name down, but i don't know about his. he showed interest before long, long time ago. but,

 1:06:55  
is not in code for america is slack. but let me get his email

unknown speaker  1:07:22  
are hey,

 1:07:35  
doesn't hurt to ask

unknown speaker  1:07:39  
me. cool.

 1:07:55  
like asked me or just sort of

 1:08:13  
so you mentioned that this survey was already built.

unknown speaker  1:08:20  
um.

unknown speaker  1:08:23  
okay, uh, i guess i would like some

 1:08:29  
clarification on. when do you expect the first iteration of bob to or the new iteration to come about, based on

these responses that you're gathering

 1:09:36  
so, is there any way that i guess. yeah, as a participant that can be like, get involved, just with staying loose with updates like is there an email list that i could subscribe to, um, rather than joining it you guess black or, or just to at least stay informed of like, hey, this is where we're at with this project, as i know, another project that has been in the works for like the past year is the project index. and it's just like, i'd like to learn more like what's going on, maybe throw, throw people your way. yes, i

 1:11:13  
number two, they're going to know.

unknown speaker  1:11:20  
um,

 1:11:34  
i would say probably like three. mmm.

 1:12:15  
thank you for listening to me rant, so.

 1:12:22  
all right, good luck on your project, and

hopefully i'll hear more from you guys.

 1:12:32  
all right, have a good day.

yeah, just a little bit about me i'm looking for a job right now. so i've been looking for jobs since february, and luck is sucking me over because i've been, it's been a dry spell since then. but this month. this week i have, i'm in, i'm towards the final rounds of three different jobs so it's just been exhausting preparing and getting. i just got off an interview, like an hour ago so it's just the mental energy to get to get through the rest of my day. yeah.

 5:29  
yeah i'm super, it's just it's just like, i don't know luck luck it's really. i don't know all the luck i had waiting till the end of this year, every good luck that i was gonna happen last weekend is happening this week so

 5:47  
yeah.

 5:54  
today. not that route but i'm already letting it go right i think okay

 7:33  
that's amazing.

 7:39  
i'm a designer too so i'm gonna steal this.

 7:53  
that's amazing. i'm sorry i don't want to i know you observe stuff so let's let's go into yourself but yeah that's so that's super cool.

 8:18  
by the way, i'm from la, but i'm based in chicago now.

 8:26  
i grew up in east hollywood but the last place i lived in was k town.

 8:36  
oh i used to work in culver city, i fucking hate that that that area gets, it's just a nightmare to go through in terms of traffic. such,

 8:53  
yeah, but it's nice area, sorry, but yeah it's a nightmare to go there.

 9:35  
okay. is that well let me. sorry, go ahead go finish, we're gonna say,

 9:41  
is it does that mean like, i like, i could be quoted that my data will be shown.

 10:39  
and then i'm gonna give you my, my backup just in case one doesn't work.

unknown speaker  10:42  
all right.

 11:05  
yes, correct. i am in chicago.

 11:35  
so, tangent but just fyi, you're cutting off on my end for whatever reason,

 11:59  
yeah. and just to let you know 10, there's a small chance my computer might crash while we're on the zoom call, i don't have a lot of memory in this computer so i'm actually gonna run and get my phone so if that happens i'm just gonna switch over real quick, is that okay.

 12:17  
okay, let's go ahead. sorry.

when we're. i'm sorry to ask this so late but we're framing this this is in the perspective of the brigade correct, yes, not just me as a person. yeah. yeah. because i was doing the former, i was doing the former m. three.

 19:03  
no no i was operating under this is for the brigade not for not just my.

"," 19:26  
three.

"," 19:41  
i've.

"," 20:03  
um, i don't know if this falls in, when you talked about core team or lean development so this may have some overlap. i can't give you like a singular label that be helpful for you so i'm just going to sputter a bunch of words and see if it makes sense. but basically, the issue that i primarily have is. and i'm sorry there's gonna be a lot of context but it's hard to run like agile in a volunteer context, because everyone is volunteer so they contribute whatever time they have there's, you can't run sprints it's impossible. it's hard to keep people manage you. so my, my thought is like i wonder if there's something similar. is there like some sort of framework or methodology that we can utilize as a volunteer brigade, that would be helpful for us because right now what's going on is we're doing like a little con bond, which is basically, if that's if that's what it is that's fine but as we just literally have a trello board with a bunch of tickets and we're just kind of working at our own pace, which i imagine a lot of other brigades probably operate. similarly, unless they're getting paid. so i would just be interested to read more about what does that process look like. and like, yeah that's that's that's the one thing. so and i would rank that a five. i'm sorry, let me take the back of 611

 21:26  
yes, and the other one is, um, i wish there were something where i can use to have like some type of expectations, set up expectations i don't know if that's ready in that i'm gonna be very honest with you i've never read that thing ever. it was never introduced to me as part of joining the brigade, i actually am just learning about this now for the first time. so, i guess. well, hold on. that's a problem. you know i know the onboarding onto the brigade. our brigade in particular could do a better job of that. so i'm gonna say six.

 22:13  
sorry, let me, let me take. let me take a step back for this one, let's just say onboarding. alright. yeah, onboarding. that's a problem.

 22:25  
and then going back to my original point. i wish there were some sort of some sort of like you know how like i'm sorry now i'm just kind of working through my thoughts right now. you know how like a lot of workplaces have like a guide that you can go to to let you know what the company expectations are i wish there was something like that for the brigades. and i don't know if that's something that we have to decide ourselves, because that's what i've been doing, because i try to make it, i try to make the expectations just for one of the projects that we're working on. but that's that those expectations are not consistent across other projects, which could be good or bad, i don't know. so, expectations i guess would be the label for this one.

 23:18  
just as a volunteer as a volunteer. okay,

unknown speaker  23:22  
cool. yeah,

 23:34  
um, i don't know if this is something i can put into a label but something we maybe this is probably other forget tap i don't know this is something your feature and this in this, in the bo, bo p right that's right, that's the, that's what we're, that's what you're updating, um, we have a hard time onboarding people. i'm not on board people like retaining people. like i, we get a lot of people and i'm sorry i'm just working through my thoughts right now. we get a lot of people come to our brigade for the first time. and the problem we have is we don't sometimes they come with skills that we don't have projects for. so, i don't know, like i guess some type of mechanism or thing to do for people that want to be involved but we just don't have anything for them. so i don't know what what that looks like, i don't know what label that would be.

 25:32  
yeah, got it closed ended questions yes or no.

"," 25:47  
me. me myself.

 25:53  
yes i do.

 26:20  
okay, question was, do i have like a framework that i feel could work with code for chicago is that correct.

 27:11  
man that's such a great way to make me focus on my responses.

 27:29  
that's smart yeah that's you i'll get caught up in the first one right. i think that's it

 29:13  
oh, my bad. what were all these points was to have documentation behind it.

 29:26  
is not documented this is something i do personally really well.

 29:54  
okay, i'm gonna say right now everything is one that i wrote.

 30:13  
do we want help from other brigades or from code for america, is that how you're raising.

 30:22  
i don't know i'm pretty selfish, um, what does help look like um so.

 30:49  
yep yes that, in that case,

 30:55  
peer review feedback, love to hear how other people do it.

unknown speaker  30:59  
all right.

 31:22  
if you want to learn how we do this, you talk to me, because this is something i'm personally really good at

 31:37  
this is really helping my ego. oh god, this is all being transcribed.

 31:49  
sure.

 31:57  
um, i believe it's one. um, and, are you gonna ask me the same set of questions as the first one is the same set of question. what kind of documentation

 32:14  
still 101.

 32:22  
yeah, as far as i know 10, it's one, so i don't, i don't know if there is ryan could have read and stuff krista could have written stuff but i that is not something that sounds to me personally.

 32:43  
peer review.

 32:57  
i will talk to ryan. my brigade captain. and if she's my i don't think chris has a cobra gate app anymore but she's open. i would talk to her. all right, let me write their names down.

 33:55  
oh yeah expanded. mom, i yeah i think it's always important to set some type of expectations, and so the thing i've done, so we're doing to give you some context, we're doing a project with a with a nonprofit we're creating an interactive map, and we're still, we're still kind of like an exploration framing part of this process. but the thing i think i do very well, is that oftentimes you if you have. once you start having these groups. some people will start to dip, because enthusiasm, will wear off, i only know this because i used to work in the nonprofit space and it worked for a lot of volunteers so enthusiasm, usually wears off. the most important thing is having them still feel included in some sort of way. and so, if they miss a meeting, i don't let that pass my radar, i always follow up and check in with them and say hey how's it going, i'm just following up on the things you said you were going to work on last time. and that's it. you know, honestly, you can't like fire people or penalize them, but i feel like people feel a sense of my, my hypothesis is, or, sorry the assumption of operating under is that people respond well when they feel like they're included. and if, when you check in with them for something that's pro bono and they're only giving you their time they feel guilty. so, i think by me, following up with them through slack has been really helpful.

 35:32  
yeah one

 35:40  
yeah, i think so. add formatting to that so.

 35:59  
this one or this one. talk to me.

 36:16  
i mean those are the ones that come to mind right now that i feel is most pertinent, and important to what we do. it's just, it just the overall theme is just structure structures like very hard, because that dog ad hoc nature of that toddler brigade spark, because there's no emotion people kind of come in and out.

 37:07  
my, my role right now is just, i function at designer and right, i guess a product manager to for some of our projects

 37:25  
oh man that's hard. i'm like, active members right now. well, how do you define active

 37:42  
okay. do i give you an exact number or an estimate

 37:53  
yeah. i would say anywhere from 10 to 30. we've had at least that many active members. 30 might be a bit much but i definitely would have had an uptick ticket, in the last couple of months.

 38:18  
shit, i don't know. um, i think they started the brigade back in 2018 wrong about that though. i don't know, sorry.

 38:43  
i have it yeah, this is something that's just become, i mean i think inside that playbook is the style guide is right for the code for america.

 39:04  
yep, i mean maybe i'm not privy to because i'm not a brigade captain yet.

 39:31  
what is what is self service mean.

 39:53  
just to clarify what you just said, you will ask my team my team members the same questions you asked me. is that what that is. and

 40:06  
um, yeah, sure. like i sorry let me, let me take a step back. self service survey i should share like a link with them and they just fill it out.

 40:27  
oh, yeah, am i interested or are you think my team members would be interested because.

 40:41  
i don't know it's hard to say, i think it'd be helpful. i think it'd be helpful.

 41:16  
i'm looking for members that could talk about this that had been long enough.

unknown speaker  41:24  
so,

 41:27  
yeah, i'm struggling because i can't think of any members that. i'm sorry, operating on assumptions, sorry if it sounds egotistical. i don't know anyone that would provide you valuable information, we haven't had members that stayed as long as i have that aren't the captains. i mean i can give you one name and i just couldn't decipher so would that be helpful.

 41:51  
yeah.

 41:53  
do you want me to provide her information or information to you.

 42:01  
let me go ahead and i'll post, i put in the chat for you.

 42:38  
anything we should ask her

 42:46  
yeah, i think i kind of hit all the main things i wanted to communicate my challenges would code for america it's mostly just structure. i'm just interested to see, to hear like to read how other people like run their groups. i think we do the best that we can. but i think it could be helpful to have some sort of structure to our projects as well. so, um, but yeah, other than that i don't have anything else to share.

unknown speaker  43:32  
cool.

 43:52  
all right, you can do one. i trust you, you won't.

 44:05  
what i said my might be embarrassing for my pregame what do you think you think we've been bursting from my pocket. um,

 44:13  
i'm not ashamed, huh.

 44:28  
i just want to help out okay one.

 44:48  
was helpful. i hope that was helpful.

 44:54  
yeah.

 45:32  
oh man. i'm really sorry hard on here i don't know are you are y'all working right now.

 45:56  
it's tough. um,

 46:00  
yeah, i'm a designer, i used to work in the nonprofit space. before i became a designer.

 46:11  
yeah, more ux, i want to be a generalist, but i i'm mostly interested in ux if i pick.

 46:44  
i found it really helpful i don't know like how active is the hack for la brigade you start y'all have projects that are going on.

 47:32  
yeah, i do you also is the makeup of the most, i mean wrapping, i don't know, this is anecdotal now but are a lot you feel like a lot of the members who get are people that are fresh out of boot camps and grad programs and careers career changers are trying to get get more more experience, because that's the sample size i'm working, i'm, i work with your corporate chicago, and i fall in that category as well.

 48:37  
i can't imagine la is such a fuck fest so you get all bunch of weirdos to come in. um, that's not a comment on that. that's my own that's my own opinion.

 48:48  
why'd i move. yeah. la sucks man i can't pay for shit over there dude. it's so expensive catering like almost like two kids. huh. it's,

 49:01  
not as bad as la i can leave take a bus place i can take a train places, i'm tired of driving 10 i'm tired driving the place to place. i don't want to drive anymore. that's the main decision. you can think wow, just wonderful. well,

 49:36  
yeah. do you remember where you stayed, did you stay like in a like an adolescent

 49:45  
i don't know, were you backpacking across america. and when you finished your undergrad is that what it

 50:05  
i say i say,

unknown speaker  50:06  
yeah.

 50:06  
how are you liking la.

 50:21  
yeah. i fucking hate orange county. oh well i speak with such a bias i grew up in la, so i just have i know i know i

 50:39  
orange county is weird because la is. i'm sorry we get political la is very left leaning orange county, as like weird trump areas, and there. it's so bizarre. definitely not la at all.

 51:06  
yeah, i, um, oh, one more thing i wanted to mention, fuck you stop recording but i you know that one of the challenges we also have is, it's, we are, we're, we're so kind of like it it's great that our brigade captains have experience, but because it helps guide people that are very junior, but sometimes we are in project for we're not quite sure ourselves if we're junior so it's always good to have the thing i've always wondered like how can we sustain people who have actual experience, that's, that's the one that's harder to just to keep. i wonder about that. sorry i thought just came to me right now as we were talking. um,

 52:18  
yeah, or at least having that resources available because, like what the problem that we're facing sometimes is, if we're working on a project. and it requires a technical prowess, that we don't have ourselves. then we often are either googling shit, or like asking other junior people which i don't think is an ideal situation so it's always good to have people that are more senior if they're not active members at least people that you can like tap into to ask questions.

 53:08  
yeah, that's it. i just we're just bullshitting now but we can call it, i'm adding you on linkedin as we speak. nice to meet you, raquel hope this conversation was was helpful for you too.

unknown speaker  53:19  
hey, yes, that'd be helpful.

 53:36  
to take care of santa's killer cow. all right, take care,

unknown speaker  53:39  
thank you later.

0," 4:04  
hi. sorry i'm late. it took me a minute to get back there.

 4:16  
are we waiting on bonnie as well or

 4:48  
yeah that's that's a good thing i guess like interview i noticed a little bit. there we go.

 5:02  
like staring at a mirror, i know.

 5:49  
fine. let's go ahead.

 6:54  
most people do because that's how it's spelled, and. yeah. interesting. the bastardization of the thawne awesome name for tucson which was joke's on, so you actually are more correct with it having the heart see but, yeah, that's not the way anyone pronounces it anymore.

 7:19  
all right, especially with with native words you know that they've been appropriated and changed.

 7:43  
yeah, i don't wouldn't i was born in la and i couldn't tell you what it is either so, yeah.

"," 9:15  
that's an interesting one because i mean i would say as far as posting the hacknight, i think we do it well so i guess if you're just specifically talking about hacknight, themselves, i would say one. but, yeah, it's kind of hard to give a really clear answer because i mean one of the challenges that we and i'm sure a lot of other brigades are having as well is getting people involved in the brigade and recruiting new people, which is probably a different question.

 10:00  
yeah that hasn't been a challenge because we've usually either had free space offered by the university of arizona, or other organizations. you know like we originally when i first started the brigade we were meeting at a co working space downtown. eventually unfortunately in co working space shut down so then we moved to the university but i was able to get free space there so you know it's always easy to find a space, and be able to have somewhere to have the meeting. the issue of course is related to that of just getting the word out and getting people to the meetings, right,

"," 10:46  
that did not. i mean, again i thought that the support so i would say. number one, because i mean i think the support we had from the, from code for america and the organizers was really great. i mean, i think that since they started doing it i've done a number of i think i've done the national day of civic hacking ever since we started the brigade in 2013 so it's something that we've usually done i've liked that there have been some focus areas, although the focus areas, haven't always been what we were necessarily wanting to focus on so that's the only issue i had there but, yeah, i thought that the, you know, organizing materials and everything were really great this year compared to some last years. so, yeah, didn't think that we needed a lot of help. again did not get a lot of turnout, and it was true both for code for tucson and also i was in contact with code for phoenix, and so we ended up working together on a project but we didn't turn out. okay, to be honest.

 12:03  
no, no, they were, at least i don't think they may have been in there i don't know i mean i can't say that i've really looked at what all is in the bop has been with you. so yes, the, the organizers made sure they contacted everyone messenger is on the promoted on the various channels slack and everything else that code for america uses and once we signed up, they did provide materials to support us, and you know also the priority areas are being worked on. so that part worked really well and data sources everything else that we needed for that. okay.

 12:54  
well, yeah and i, again i guess it's a question of which. yeah, i mean if you're looking at, it would be probably be harder if we didn't have the organizing materials that were provided for national day of civic hacking and all that although i have done some that have been pretty free, free form in the past because we've had some years where there really weren't any recommendations and so we just had people, investigate you know made a list of resources available to them for open data to work with and just had them decide what they want to work on which that works well too so again i would say one i mean i don't think that there's a need for an example, necessarily because i mean, we've done it, like i said since 2013 and i think we've done it well, certainly the number of people who've been changed, you know, but in the past the national day of stalking. those were our biggest events and this past year it was basically two people, you know, so we're

unknown speaker  14:01  
2020,

unknown speaker  14:02  
yeah,

"," 14:17  
okay, that. and again yeah it's like okay wouldn't example be good or because i do think that every. i also used to be with the san francisco brigade when i was in the bay area. and so, i mean, i've seen how it works differently in different areas and. oh folks i saw how it worked with them code for phoenix actually formed because they had been reached out to by the maricopa county department of health, and they needed some help with a project. and that's actually how code for phoenix got started so i mean they had their municipal partner on board before they even became an brigade. for us, we've had a lot of struggles it's just it's been hard to keep cultivate those relationships, and so i'm not sure if. an example would be because you know like an example from la i don't know would necessarily or from oakland or from san francisco or from chicago or whatever i don't know that it wouldn't necessarily have any applicability here, where you know you've got a city government and a county government who generally don't tend to get along very well and then you've got the state government as well which doesn't get along with either one of them. and so you know you're trying to cultivate those relationships. i would say that the relationships that have been most effective for us as a brigade have been with the university, which is of course also a government agency it's a state university but yeah having good contacts with the city in the county has been a problem because we'll get somebody they'll be on board committee meetings, i'll have some project ideas and then either. they'll get reprioritized. they'll retire, they'll move to another department whatever and then we've, we've lost that one contact we had. and so, yeah, most of our projects have not been related to the municipal government, unfortunately, even, even though, andrew greenhill, who was one of the people with jen pahlka, andrew actually he loves to tell the story he's told a few times. he was at a family gathering with jen bulka and gave her the idea of starting code for america so you know they're sitting around the campfire with some drinks and she's like you know i really want to find a way to reach out and to be able to connect people with tech skills with, you know, the people who really need it, which i've observed are government agencies, you know, and he's like well you should do it, you know, just go talk to your boss see if they'll support it and you should go do it and that's kind of how code for america got started. so, it's funny, we had that connection we didn't have a brigade for a long time, and andrew greenhill is still actually in the city government but he hasn't been a good connection to the government. so, you know, it's. i'm working on it. we do have a new mayor that i actually have connections with a number of people in her office so i'm hoping that we can do some more work especially in sustainability which has been a big focus of mine so i'm hoping that that's going to be fruitful in the future, but yeah that's been the challenge, and so i don't know examples, you know, like you say i again i have the example of oakland i've seen what they've done in oakland, it's amazing. you know, even when we were in san francisco and we were struggling compared to, you know, our neighbors across the bay, because oakland had all this stuff going on and they had all these connections, and you know we're trying to bring in different agencies both governmental and non governmental agencies and do projects with them and really struggling at that time now i don't know you know that was 2011 2012 and 2013 is when i left so i don't know how i mean i don't know how the san francisco bay is doing these days but i know we were really struggling to come up with such that we can keep moving and the kind of thing i've seen in tucson where you know the projects that were consistently being worked on or things like maintaining the web page. so, we haven't done a good job of that i need to get a new webpage up. but, you know, yeah i guess when you keep saying an example, i don't know, it could be useful but it may also not be applicable at all. so, it's hard.

 18:43  
yeah, so as tucson is. yep,

 19:38  
i know and that's why i'm really struggling because it's like, how about three because i guess an example could be useful if it was appropriate but it's gonna be hard to find the right examples i think for a lot of us, smaller brigades or brigades in different states you know like i am curious about some of the florida brigades for example how or like the code for new orleans you know like how applicable a code, an open oakland example would be so, yeah.

"," 20:36  
yeah i mean we've had connections in fact some of our more successful projects have actually been related to nonprofits, and instead of governmental agencies, for example, we did a project called community share that was kind of like a dating service for school teachers and professionals in the community which is funny because actually my day job is working for the microsoft philanthropies teals program which is very much the same thing where we recruit volunteers to go help high school teachers teach computer science. so, very much related to this project that i worked on years before i was working for microsoft philanthropies, but the idea was, you know, i helped josh actor who was the founder of this project i helped him to get his initial grant so i sat down with them went through together the lien because everything he was going to need for his application helped him do some estimating of how much to ask for. and he went he got his initial grant to be able to start this project and then we worked on it for a while to get him a working prototype so we got him to the point of his second phase funding and then of course after that, he took the funding and built a team and off they went. they weren't a part of us anymore but we got them launched so that was probably one of our biggest successes. other things we have tried working with other nonprofits or others that have needs and i'm aware of biggest problem we have there and i don't know if you're hearing this much from the people you're talking to, but the biggest problem i have working with both governmental agencies and nonprofit agencies is having that project champion available, because they like to come in and say, oh, we need, you know, we need a map we do gleaning in the community and we need a map to know where all the properties are that we can glean fruit from. okay, that sounds great. now, we need somebody who's going to be there to help us make sure that we're building the product, product you need, and you know they never show up again. so that's a big problem and i don't know how you address that i mean that's actually a problem even in just development in general not necessarily just code for america.

 23:13  
i would say again probably three i guess i'm an example could be useful again it depends how much relate to what we're trying to do

 23:47  
they don't, they aren't you know you really need a champion who's going to be there regularly. so you can run ideas by them check progress with them, make sure you're making the product that they actually want because i mean there's nothing more frustrating than spending six months or a year putting something together, only to find out that it's not actually even meeting their needs because they weren't giving you any feedback, where.

"," 24:35  
i mean i have some approaches i do but yeah, i think, again, three is gonna seem really redundant. but yeah, i see an example could be useful because i'm sure there are other approaches i mean i tend to use a lean canvas or a you know storyboarding approach and you know there probably are other ways of gathering those requirements and getting feedback that, you know, would be good to have an example of so yeah i can see an example could be useful for that.

"," 25:18  
okay, yeah, i would say one, i mean we do that well we do, typically try to you know do story do story cards user stories or prioritize prioritizing the functionality and do sprints hasn't always been successful but yeah i think that we've, you know, multiple air have, you know, experienced with lean canvas and have done scrum or something like that so i mean we're pretty familiar with agile and lean practices.

"," 26:02  
yeah i think a three on that an example could be useful for that because, again, i mean i had a background in requirements traceability and user testing you know but that and unit testing and system testing you know so i mean i'm pretty familiar with that but i think there's certainly always an opportunity for you know somebody may have an idea that something i hadn't thought of that would be really a good way to to get it out there, you know, and we haven't done much like you know for example we've never really had the resources to do a b testing for examples so it'd be interesting to see if anybody has had that experience, you know, because you usually need a larger team and code for tucson has never been a large brigade so you know usually need a larger team to have an a an a, b, product to be able to compare against each other.

 27:30  
yeah i think that there again probably a three and example could be useful i mean i've seen both within code for america and outside when there been code of conduct issues, there was a rather famous one a couple of years ago which you may not have been aware of since you weren't here at the time but yeah there was, there was a rather significant code of conduct issue with the national brigade, our national leadership team members so yeah, i've. those of us are here at the time saw that one kind of close up. and i didn't know the individual that that was related to but we haven't really had issues but i mean i think it's something that we also always need to be aware of and just because we've been lucky and haven't had to deal with that i have been with another organization where that issue did come up with one of our members and, yeah, it can be, you know, we weren't prepared for it in that organization because we didn't have any procedures in place to deal with a formal complaint harassment complaint or anything. and so yeah, it would be good to have examples especially examples that, you know, maybe would be along the guidelines of what code for america would expect in a situation like that.

unknown speaker  28:55  
oh, that makes sense examples

 29:02  
yep yeah something where you can go and gives you just some a starting point. and then you know also maybe some recommendations for what kind of procedures, you should have in place like i said with this other nonprofit organization i was associated with those weren't in place you know it was kind of having to wing it and come up with the procedure for dealing with a complaint on the fly, which is not the way you want to do it.

 29:45  
well it wasn't brigade it was another nonprofit that i'm associated with.

unknown speaker  29:51  
okay. so,

 30:07  
are establishing some guidelines. i mean i think we do have some, there are certainly i mean we have the code of conduct and there has been some discussion about ",," 31:06  
that was something we did really well when we went, as i said code for tucson started unofficially in 2013, that's when we had our first event it was national day of civic hacking actually. and then you know for about the next two years we were in the formative process, when we actually spun up as an official brigade we did have a lot of success recruiting and building a core team and finding you know roles for anyone. and then over time, those core team members dropped off, new core team members didn't replace them until you know for probably two or three years i'd say three years. it was just myself and my co captain michelle hertzfeld, and then michelle moved to australia. so since then it's been me, so the core team has me core team of one.

 32:07  
yeah.

 32:25  
yep. so yeah, i guess, a three maybe i mean i guess, again it's like what it kind of comes down to that recruiting thing which i know you haven't gotten to yet hopefully there is a question on that. it's really yeah recruiting and grooming new members and so we've had i had one member of the brigade, that was going to ask to be part of the core team as you know trying to build a database or get raised hasn't been involved lately and i think it's partly because with the university furloughs i think he got laid off so he's off. i don't even know where he is now so i've had that happen with a couple of people who were university employees who got furloughed. so, yeah, you know i don't know quite how to deal with the people dropping out so it's related to not just the ability to build a core team but also being able to recruit and recruit and groom people to be able to be part of the core team, and that's kind of the challenge.

 34:18  
okay, great.

"," 34:30  
i would say a one on that, i mean we've, the layout for the strategic plan is very well formatted, and we've generally had a good, you know, a good planning process when we've had multiple. the core team. you know this past year it was just me trying to figure out what i'd like to do and of course one of the things is trying to grow the brigade and also reestablish some of those contacts that we've lost with, especially the city of tucson i think there's an opportunity to work with the mayor's office so just developing that and working on projects to support them, because they. the my interest of course has been very much in dealing with climate change i mean we just went through the hottest year on record in tucson we're in the middle of a terrible drought we've had the drier one of the driest years on record as well so you know we need to start dealing with this we can't keep pretending that it's not an issue. the mayor and council did actually just recently declare a climate emergency in tucson so you know they're trying to do things on that. and i think there's a lot of room for the brigade to get involved with supporting them with either things to help educate the public or to visualize data i mean think there's a lot of opportunities for us there so that's what i'm hoping to do in the future, but of course it was mostly me planning where i wanted to go because right now the brigade has really, there's a team that's working with me on one project we're working on the opportunity project right now which is run through the census bureau in fact i think if you've talked to code for south florida they're also one of the teams that's working on the opportunity project. they're doing something on air quality and we're doing something on ocean plastic pollution, which seems kind of funny it should be the other way around, but because we got an ocean nowhere near us. so florida's right there with an ocean but for whatever reason, those are the projects we're working on. and you know there i have a team that's been working with me but even there my team of recent grads from a uae boot camp have all kind of flaked on me over times, i'm finding i'm kind of the person keeping that budget con due. so yeah, i think it's a common issue right now, especially in this age where you know we're all doing things virtually and there's just a lot of stress on people for trying to find work and whatever else. yeah, that's kind of where we're at. but strategic plan. yeah, i don't think that's been a problem sorry that was kind of a long roundabout answer to the question.

 37:09  
yeah, but i would say one would be the number, because i think we do a well i don't think we need an example there's a good template for it. and it's just a process of, you know, sitting down with whoever's, a member of the brigade at the time and figuring out what they want to do for the next year, you know where, what do we want our goals to be okay.

unknown speaker  37:31  
one.

"," 38:09  
yeah, i can't say i really do strategic plans for projects but we do certainly do project plans and depending on how formal the project is ripes house or project plan is. so, i don't know, i guess, maybe three there i mean i could see an example could be useful if you know you've got a project that you're working with a partner that has very specific requirements, it could maybe be good to have a template of what was done in the past but i don't find that to be a big problem but i could see where it could be helpful in some cases.

 38:59  
yeah. yeah, i mean if you've dealt with, you know, like i. in another life i was actually in government acquisitions so you know there's a very specific format of everything you have to have to document a project, you know now as a brigade we don't normally get involved in things like that but you do still sometimes deal with, you know, city or county government representatives and they do have things they have to be able to take to their boss and they have very specific documentation requirements for those and so yeah, it, it can be helpful if somebody worked with, you know, i mean i'm sure i know open oakland has had these issues for example because they worked with the city and the county. and so they've done projects with them where they've had very specific requirements, i'm sure for documenting a project. right.

"," 39:53  
that has not been. see what number i mean we really haven't done it, because we really haven't had the need so far. but you know if we could grow and if we could do bigger projects that might maybe would need additional funding for either, you know, services like hosting services where i mean what's the stuff we get free through code for america or in our space has been provided by the university so i've been lucky in that case i mean i do know there are probably brigades that have to pay rent for spaces when they're using them and that kind of thing but we haven't really had that. so, again yeah i guess the three i mean an example could be useful of how people have done their fundraising, but typically we haven't had to do it, so it hasn't been an issue for me. yeah.

 41:10  
i mean that's typically the only time we've ever really received money from anyone was one we did a big one of our biggest at that national day of civic hacking i was talking about that was our biggest event. we actually had donations and for food and for buying t shirts, i still have some of the t shirts of that. and that was something that, you know, we didn't necessarily have to go out and hunt it down we just had people that were associated with brigade they're like well you know i can ask. i put one on work for ibm it's like i can ask my company to donate $1,000 and they did. so, you know, but it was like we didn't really go out and hunt it down or anything. they just brought it in, you know,

"," 42:23  
i would say the tools we've been, i haven't taken full advantage and this is on me for not doing a better job of actually taking advantage of all the resources code for america has provided

 42:40  
yeah, it's just what is that because there are a lot of things that i'm thinking wow it would be really great if we had done that you know it's like you know we've had the tools we've needed, i'm normally for our, our meetings right now i've been using meat although i could also use zoom because code for america can get you a zoom account as well so you know i just i use me for other things so i've been using it for the brigade as well. but yeah, i mean, i really can't say that we've ever had an issue where we didn't have the tools we needed, you know, with github. you know, we, a lot of our things we've tried to like the project i'm doing out right now with the opportunity project is, you know, just all a front end, it's a web web based game so it's all just front end coding it's all you know just html, css, javascript, and so it doesn't need a server on the back end, so i can host it as a git page and that's how it's running right now i mean it's live as a get paid right now. so yeah, we haven't really, you know, there may be a time in the future but i think we actually have those resources i just tend to hold on them because i mean i know we get some as your hosting and we get some aws hosting where we did in the past i think that may have gone away now but we did for years we had aws hosting through code for america so yeah it again, it hasn't been real issues so yeah i guess maybe a one. we do this well i don't think we really need an example of how to get those tools because i think we've had the tools provided through the partnership with code for america.

"," 44:26  
um, yeah definitely use some examples on that i would say that would be a three an example could definitely be useful because it's something it's always a struggle. you know, we do have a logo that i like and we've gotten it out there and so people recognize it now but you know our media strategy has been essentially what we've been able to do it could be much better. i mean, you know, if i had people on board who could do things like you know, a regular blog or something that we could, you know, a medium page whatever some way that we could get content out there and give back to the community and also make people aware of us, that would be great and so you don't know that we've done you know we have a. we have a meetup page, we've got, you know, a facebook page which i don't know when i first came to tucson facebook was the only way you could get people to know about your events and so we've had it ever since then but i don't know that anybody looks at the facebook page anymore. but we still have it, and i still post events on there, but yeah i don't know that meetup or facebook event is effective and getting burnt out i really haven't you know i haven't had the time and i have another pet other people to help out with really doing like you know media blitz is about things getting stuff out on twitter and wherever else you know just trying to get reddit, whatever you know wherever places i know reddit is pretty active here. so, yeah, it's just getting the word out, and we did also, i probably haven't done as good a job of that. initially when we first did some of our first events we had like tv coverage for some of them. and we haven't really followed up on that. that's something that we, it's not that hard. if you have a story you call up you know one of the local tv stations say hey we're doing an event would you like to do a little community coverage, you know, and they're usually willing to send a film crew out and talk about it. so, yeah, i just haven't done that.

 46:46  
yep, it's the bandwidth issue. okay, maybe,

"," 46:59  
um, that was i mean it was so long ago that we did it, but yeah in the past i think that was kind of always kind of ad hoc when i first came on i mean i basically firmed the, you know, started forming the brigade, and finding out what to do, just by contacting hannah young because i'd known her when i was with code for san francisco, so it's like you know, i sent a message to anna hey what do we need to do now, you know, and so there really wasn't a real formal process so i mean that was so many years ago i don't know what that process is like, i mean i think it is much more formalized but at this point i don't know. yeah, we did it. like i said, seven years ago so i don't know that there's really anything i could say that would be applicable to somebody trying to do it now.

 48:11  
that down as maybe a zero on that i really don't know about that because i don't know what the current process looks like, i don't know hopefully you got some good feedback from tom because code for phoenix actually did start i tried to help them a little bit as they're getting launched but yeah they, they launched just a couple years ago so they actually are a fairly recent brigade i don't know of the others you've spoken to how many are new but code for phoenix is fairly new, as

unknown speaker  48:37  
well,

 48:50  
there may have been. yeah, i can't remember who actually got started, but it wasn't very long ago they did it. so, yeah.

"," 49:06  
yeah, that would be helpful. so i would say three on that i think that's something i don't think any of us have broken the code on how best to open source projects so i think any examples you have they're useful. okay,

"," 49:35  
yeah, it's a challenge, i mean i again yeah i guess that three example could be useful if somebody had a lot of success doing recruiting in this age of covid or has figured out how to keep the engagement up i've had this problem with not just because i do more than code for tucson is if i don't already have too many things to do so. you know, all of the things that i do. it's been hard to keep engagement and even at work it's been hard to bring people into the events that we have like we have meetups quarterly meetups for our volunteers. the hard to get them to engage. so, yeah, i think there's definitely challenges to doing this, there are benefits to i mean it was nice i was able to go to the brigade congress this year i wouldn't have had time to take off from work. otherwise, but i was able to do it because it was, it was virtual. also, there are pluses to that but yeah i think if anyone has examples where they've been really successful it would be great to see that. okay.

"," 50:58  
i think well except for the achieve. so, again, i would say, a one we do this well you really have focus we've always had in our brigade membership it hasn't been just the typical you know white male that you see in so much of tech it's like we've had a good diverse mix. i certainly, and i struggle with this not just with code for tucson but other things i'm doing including my day job trying to reach out to for example, the indigenous community. we are next to one of the largest actually arizona has two of the largest native nations in the, in it and yet you know it's really hard to make those relationships and get them on board and i would really love to be able to get them involved, provide the opportunities for people to develop skills and also to, you know, reflect their needs in some of what we do so yeah that's that's a challenge. so again, i know that they're doing some incredible work in hawaii i heard about that at the brigade congress. so yeah, maybe if they're. i would say we do it well because we know how to set those goals and we've been good for the city of tucson, but i'd like to expand that so i guess maybe it's a one and a three so you know like if there's some good examples and i think there are plenty of good examples from code for hawaii for example that they could really illustrate how they were able to bring their community in and that hopefully could also carry over to what others are doing because i know i'm not the only brigade that's near a significant significantly sized indigenous nation and i think it's important for us to reach out to them or. same thing if you're in the south, you know, it's reaching out to the underrepresented communities like black and african american communities, i think is really important. but other than that i think yeah generally we've done a pretty good job of reaching out to the community ease and getting, you know, at least what represents tucson well represented.

 53:36  
okay, no problem. i know how that goes. i do interviews and stuff all the time where i have a rubric i'm trying to keep up with so not a problem.

"," 54:02  
um, we can do that, i guess i need samples to be useful. there are some that are relevant. we have had brigade members who have gone on to work in local government jobs and we've had brigade members who have been part of local government but yeah i think it would be a real service if we had a better way because i do get a lot of people. you may have heard this from other brigades as well i get a lot of people who are, you know, either transitioning from other jobs and they're wanting to, you know, be a web developer or whatever and so they're building up their portfolio, and it would really be nice to be able to help them connect with work that they can do because that's the biggest challenge i see i get so many, you know, bootcamp graduates who spent a ridiculous amount of money going to a boot camp and then they can't find work afterwards you know so it would really be nice if we can find a way to make that connection get them involved in a project that then maybe they can actually continue to work on and develop within the agency that that product is being made for.

unknown speaker  55:11  
okay.

 55:13  
should i guess i would say three example could be useful, especially if it's relevant.

 55:55  
absolutely. yeah, when i when i was doing my ee degree at utah state, the electrical engineer degree which is like a phd but nobody recognizes it as that but it's a post master's degree that's sort of industry focused and my one of my advisors actually said, i don't think we can give you the degree yet because you haven't suffered enough. seriously. that's what he said. it's like, oh, okay.

"," 56:39  
yeah. again a three an example could be useful there i could certainly see again i have some experience in that but i mean it's it's an ever changing thing the recommendations change all the time. you know i was fortunate enough when i was in the bay area and got laid off because microsoft acquired the company i, the startup i worked for and they said we don't need you anymore but they did send me off to robert half to like, you know, get my resume done and everything so i went through all those classes on how to prepare a resume and then i used to work for the pima county library and worked in job help so i help people do it, but it's funny how even in that period of time of like, you know, three years or so. the recommendations changed about like what a resume should look like. so yeah, i would say anything that's working now that you can get examples of would be very helpful, because it does change all the time,

 58:00  
all. no, not at all. all right.

"," 58:14  
so recruitment. yes, that would be the primary one recruitment and retention, and maybe development as well so i mean i think those all three they're all related so i mean you know getting new people in i've actually pre covid, we were pretty successful in bringing people in so you know we could get the interest up people would come to join a meeting. they might come back a couple of times but then disappear, you know, and so it's a thing of not only bringing them in initially but then finding something useful and i think this is where as a brigade captain i've most struggled is trying to have tasks that are ready to go for people at different level of skill and deal with different backgrounds. so, you know, if you have somebody comes in with like ux skills, we need to have something that's ready for them to work on that's going to be you know redesigning something to be more useful or do user testing or whatever that particular product needs. and same thing with, you know, if somebody just graduated from boot camp or if they're, you know, interested, you know they're just sort of dabbling and they're trying to find out about this weird thing they've called they've heard about called web development, you know, how do you get them engaged and have a have something that's a task that they can feel that they're meaningly meaningfully engaged in what you're working on, you know, you don't want to just give them busy work. and so that's been a challenge, i think it's been really hard to find things in fact i've seen that in. see scavenger that game we're making for the opportunity project is that, i think it rather quickly got beyond the skill level of a lot of the team members, which is why a lot of them started dropping off because it's like, i don't understand this and i don't think i can do this. so, yeah, it's really having those tasks and that's something i haven't done a good job of is being able to just have you know like on github have a list of issues where there are some good for beginner issues that they can just take and start working on right away. and, yeah, that would be something i think really would help a lot because that's part of that, that retention. and then of course development would just be skills development we've been doing sessions on web development for example so i brought in some instructors from the uae to actually teach html programming classes or html class session. it's kind of funny

unknown speaker  1:00:44  
that you you know.

 1:00:46  
but, yeah, but yeah it's good to be able to give them those skills because a lot of them that's what they want so we get to get this mix sometimes we'll get really experienced people, and they can get frustrated with the new with all the new developers and then the new developers and they just feel lost and, you know, it's kind of hard to bring them up to speed at one at one point i was reaching out to free code camp because they had had a group in tucson that it stopped meeting and so i was trying to incorporate them as part of our hacknight. and it just didn't work as well as i thought it would because they would all come in at different parts of the free code camp needing help on something different you know and so it was, it was kind of hard, you'd either have people that were there just doing one on one with them and then we can do anything else. or it would be hard to know how to help a larger number which is why i started doing the tutorials instead of trying to help you know do the beyond demand help with free code camp. but, yeah, it's, i think that's really important i think that's probably a challenge that a lot of brigades i saw that when i was in san francisco, as well as it's really got people coming in at different levels. they want to be engaged they want to do something but they don't necessarily know where they fit, and it's really hard. as an organizer to be able to have those things for them to work on.

 1:02:28  
it's a challenge. it really is a challenge to have and i think it's possible i think at any brigade. if you can do enough work to generate some projects and some of it can be internal, you know like, updating the webpage is something i think every brigade always has to do. there's always something that needs to be done on your webpage, like, like my knees be up right now because ours. we i had to take it down because we were using jekyll and it, the ruby version had gotten so out of date that it was a security hazard so it's like okay we're gonna take this down. but you know that's something that you always there's always something you can find but it is a challenge i mean it's a lot of work to try and identify bite size tasks that someone can do in a couple of weeks, and you know feel that they're doing something meaningful and it can meet different skill sets, you know, and different interests as you're saying so. yeah, it's just it's, again, it's a lot of work i think it's something i'd be curious to hear what other brigades are finding on that because i'm sure that they have the same struggle is trying to find people to get engaged, unless they're. again, oakland or san francisco or from what i've seen la or south florida seems that which is interesting because health board i never really thought of having that much tech skills but yeah south florida seems to have a large actively engaged very skilled workforce as part of their brigade, you know, and i think a lot of the smaller ones, phoenix should have that situation but phoenix, get people engaged from all over town because phoenix is so spread out that's robin, it's like la yes so you know, you know, la la itself is actually not very big but it's just surrounded by all of these other little towns and phoenix is the same way. it's exactly like that. yeah,

 1:04:28  
exactly, you on another one.

unknown speaker  1:04:29  
mm hmm. okay,

 1:04:42  
know, let's go. that's fine.

"," 1:05:20  
i'm really having to think about that because i mean our brigade has been a history of struggles so

i'm going to say no because i mean i don't know that i have no we've have had our successes, but it's been. i don't know if they've all been replicable you know i mean it's been the right project at the right time. so, that's kind of the challenge i've had so, yeah, i would say probably no because i wouldn't say that we've been wildly successful as brigade that's something i'm trying to work on. so, okay.

 1:06:38  
okay, sounds good.

 1:07:04  
that's what everyone thinks but it's actually, if you've seen the brigade logo it's a fire helmet so their model was like a fire brigade and so the captain is the head of the fire brigade, but yeah it is. that's what everyone thinks because it is kind of a funny term to use.

 1:07:33  
ships. no, it's, it's the fire brigade.

 1:07:45  
yeah, exactly. it's just like a volunteer fire brigade. yep.

 1:07:54  
well, yeah, i actually had to answer this question just recently for the renewal of the mru for next year. it depends where you look, i mean, the way i count them, we have 53 that have been active at some point during the year so that's what i reported on the rmo you paperwork for this year. but, you know, if you looked at our meetup. we got like 1053 members but that doesn't mean that we have that many that are actually engaged so yeah and then you know as far as the people that are there every single day, day in and day out, it's been me. so that's

 1:08:48  
then yeah as far as the one that's there all the time it's been me. so, just the one.

 1:09:29  
since 2013.

 1:09:41  
a. yeah, i would say seven because yeah we actually started about mid year 2013 was our first event.

 1:09:53  
i know i haven't actually. so, okay,

unknown speaker  1:09:57  
at all. um,

 1:09:59  
well, i mean i may have it may have been a link i was sent i can't say that i've read it. so,

 1:10:36  
yeah, i mean i could certainly distributed on yeah i mean i'm happy to share it out like on our slack or bring it up at meetings and, yeah, no, that'd be great. it'd be helpful. yeah.

 1:11:02  
i don't think so i mean i do have one person who is the project lead on the opportunity project but he's not been very engaged lately, i don't think, probably, he wouldn't be a useful source. so, yeah,

 1:11:22  
i think we covered it already. i mean, we just covered the things that i think are probably most critical to most brigades right now which is you know recruiting request retention and development, and maybe also long term sustainability so you know how do you, that was another challenge. i even saw in san francisco is, you might get to the point you've developed your project, it's ready to you know be turned over to your customer whoever that was, and then they don't have a plan for keeping it maintained and keeping it alive. so that's that's really frustrating you just feel like you know you've wasted half a year or a year of your life making this product that nobody's going to use now. so, that's something that i think the ones i've seen be most successful with code for america, for example, we were involved in get your refund and i actually did just sign up to help out next year because i really enjoyed that process of working on get your refund. and, you know, that one was very well supported but that's because national was supporting it. they were hosting it, they were making it work they, you know, reached out and got the partnerships to make. and so, yeah, i think that my experience over the years with code for america is i think we do a lot of really cool projects i don't know how many of them actually you know, with a few exceptions like like calfresh i think is another one that's been one that's been successful, but a lot of the projects have not actually survived, much longer after the time they were developed so that's something i think we really need to address and i know that code for america is aware of that issue.

 1:13:45  
exactly. and there are some good reasons for that too and i think that's something that maybe code for america hasn't done as good i mean i think they're doing a little better job but what i observed in both the, the projects that we've worked on, and also the some of the projects that i worked on in san francisco is, again, it's that working with the ultimate customer and understanding their needs and their abilities, you know, for example, we built this one project for children's council of san francisco, and you know it was a really great project it was make it much easier to find daycare for people who are eligible for the government subsidized daycare. and we, you know, built this up we're using like a, you know, no sql database and you know it was all a web based project and there go, they come back and they go well that's great but we're a windows shop and everything needs to be an asp with, you know, sql server and we're like, oh, okay, well that needs to be redeveloped then so yeah that's that i think that is another failing that i've seen repeated in code for america. a number of times. so yeah, that comes down to requirements and really understanding what your customer can support because, ultimately, you're, you know, you're not going to maintain that whatever that project is you're not going to maintain that product over time you're going to give it to your government customer and they're going to productize it for their needs, you know, and it's that that's a challenge at that transition is something that has been a challenge. all along for code for america and again i know they've talked about it i've, i've been at summits where it's been talked about i mean we've, we've talked about this before so it's not like it's a new thing. but it is something that probably still needs a lot of work and examples of how to make that happen. okay. all right,

 1:16:38  
yep. okay, yeah. yeah. and thank you, thank you for doing this and thanks for spending the time asking the questions i mean it's always good to know that code for america is wanting to get that input and try and improve the process. so, yeah, very much appreciate that.

 1:17:34  
yeah, it's been really helpful i mean it would have been hard for what we do without that you have a connection so it's been a good thing.

 1:17:51  
sounds good. thank you so much.

unknown speaker  1:17:53  
all right, bye.

 1:17:53  
you have a good weekend.

",dan (code for tucson),,022_codefortucson_2020-11-27_Dan-Stormont.txt
0," 0:03  
do i need to say that i consent to being recorded? so that it's on the recording?

 0:19  
we will know, i don't know the procedure. so,

unknown speaker  0:21  
yeah. just curious.

 0:44  
awesome.

 2:00  
brigade for running a brigade?

 2:04  
bonnie might think i'm on the core team, but i'm not on the court.

yeah, we'll give the best answers. i can.

 2:38  
let me read through all the numbers. okay, as an example, i don't mean we do this? well, we don't need an example. i don't need an example. example could be useful. i will need an example in the future. i wish i had an example yesterday. not having an example is limited my brigade. i feel like these are not exclusive of each other.

 3:00  
and so that's a little confusing, but since you're a human, i can answer the way i want. so exactly satisfies me.

"," 3:16  
um, we don't need any the brigade doesn't even example. um, i wouldn't be able to do it myself. and i don't want to so

"," 3:46  
do we need an example i don't think we need an example. i think we could improve our process. but we might have been able to use an example for the remote stuff. and the individual projects might have been able to use an example for, like, how to run their individual thing. i remember last year, we did a journey mapping thing. and we fortunately ended up getting someone who knew a bit about journey mapping. but like, honestly, an example wouldn't have been enough for me if i had just been running it so. so there's like running the day itself, which i think we can do as a brigade though. there might be improvements, especially on the remote the like, zoom part of it. we had trouble with like, zoom bombing. oh, and yeah, this is not fun. but, um, so there could have been some more guidance on that.

 5:13  
i don't know if we will need an example in the future, but it might be good, like maybe four as well.

"," 5:27  
we need an example.

this is a more complex question.

unknown speaker  5:35  
because

unknown speaker  5:37  
the

 5:44  
one i don't know what an example like that would look like, to some of our members, even some of our core team know how to build those relationships, i believe, but i believe a lot of the project managers are the people running the projects who are not usually not always project managers, such as myself. don't really have an example. and i don't think the core team could provide us with an example. so if there was an example from code for america, for project leads, that would be very useful, useful, and i wish i had an example yesterday type of thing. okay.

"," 6:37  
do this fairly well as a brigade. and once it's in a project, it's a little fear. but at the start of a project, that initial cultivation is very good. so i would say a one, okay. ",," 7:46  
i don't know that one either. okay.

"," 7:54  
haven't really seen it. the lean, i'm still thinking about billing. okay, awkward thing. sorry, i'm not a, i am not a like, when i give you an answer that is not, that's not the answer part of the thought process. so just just a sec. um, and if you're filling out frickin radio buttons on your computer, this look back at this recording, cuz i don't think it fully covers it. but, um,

unknown speaker  8:26  
so for project management, i

 8:31  
think, three, an example could be useful, maybe i think that some people in the core team already know it, but it doesn't trickle down to project management. so okay. sorry, go on to user something, something.

 8:56  
oh, great. i'm a slow thinker. it's perfect.

 9:05  
um, i think we may not do enough of that. that could be useful. as a project, i don't even know how to get access to my users. but if i could, and i would want to know how to use your test, but i also have people on the team who might have skills with that. so might be able to, but there but there are projects that don't. so if so, if there were a workshop on it, that could be very useful.

"," 9:53  
i don't know if we do this well or not, but i it looks like we do this well from the outside but that can be very deceptive. since like, you don't get to see it being dealt with, which i'm not sure i agree with, as on principles, first principles. so i don't know about that.

"," 10:26  
here's where i might say, i don't want my name is associated with this. yeah. but, um, i believe, i don't know if an example would help. but i believe it has been a limitation for us. so i don't know about an example. it might just, it might need to be a culture shift. but maybe an example would help create that kind of show. okay, i think it needs the process needs some help.

 11:00  
my name off this feedback?

 11:27  
right? yeah. so um,

i wish they had an example yesterday. but i might say six not having an example of limited my brigade. in that i really, it's something that i really want to have move forward. so

 11:51  
it doesn't quite hit it. but if i had to answer in order to achieve a goal, then i would answer six.

"," 12:10  
it seems to me from the outside. that is also a six, but

i don't know. i shouldn't presume.

"," 12:28  
five. i wish i had an example yesterday. okay.

it might be that it has limited my brigade. but i know that it is limited my project. so. yeah.

and four, yes, yes.

 12:52  
like i wanted to. it was like it doesn't come sit on my hands. i'm good. day has

"," 13:11  
i don't know.

i suspect. i don't know if an example. an example could help. i don't know. i don't know what that what that looks like or what they use funny. but yeah, just put, i don't know. okay.

"," 13:37  
an example could be useful three, let's say. and projects could use that as well, if that's a question. i don't know. but like, i as a project manager, not just an example, though. what i need to understand is what those tools are good for. right? so you can't just list me tools as an example to use, i need to understand in what ways these tools would be useful so that i can assess whether my team should you use a tool or not. right. tool is a good option for my team.

"," 14:25  
i don't.

and that's way above my paygrade i have no idea.

"," 15:07  
but like, how would you be contacting me if we weren't already on the national network? so i don't understand that question. so like, if my brigade were not connected with the national network, how would you know? how, how would i have received this email to answer these questions? so like, those people aren't here? i have a great my brigade does fine. like, i'm not sure they do a great job connecting individuals to the network, but i will would, i would think about that question and, and the slice of people that you are able to get to these questions. okay, that's time yeah.

guide for not just you. i mean, he was a good bet, not laying it on you to see you as a group.

 16:05  
yeah. dlp, bop, bop, bop needs to think about how folks asked me who is asking this question. okay.

 16:17  
or at least who has access to answer these questions? right? who do you have access to? so thinking about, like the answers and, and questions in terms of,

unknown speaker  16:31  
hey,

"," 16:48  
yeah, i'm example could be useful for that. i, i. i would be surprised if there were an example that could do that. because that's a like, difficult architectural problem. and a difficult process problem. but i'd be interested to see what you all have, you know, and and when it isn't possible, right to assess when it isn't possible. when it is or isn't possible, i guess. anyway.

"," 17:27  
running a remote brigade?

unknown speaker  17:30  
ah,

 17:33  
i think six and five.

yeah. and, like, for my project as well. i think i think they're doing okay. but like, i think they could be enhanced. maybe an example would be, i don't know, i just, i think there's been trouble getting new members and retaining members and not and like getting new members in and like dealing with the situation in a way that can maintain the brigade. but i'm also not on the core team, like i said, so that's just my perception.

 18:30  
three, because an example would be useful because we're still surviving. right? like, at least from what i can tell, i'm, i would say these questions about like, what an example bees oh, is a bit hard to answer, because i don't know what example means exactly.

unknown speaker  18:52  
um,

 18:56  
like an example can be very, like,

useless. so an effective example, lets you know, an effective example, i suppose, or a relevant example, like an example that is relevant to my situation. mm hmm. so i'm just going to treat it that way.

"," 19:34  
an example could be useful. i think we're doing better than we were before.

unknown speaker  19:42  
but

 19:44  
relevant example might be useful.

"," 20:04  
remaining employees? well, i don't know. i don't i don't know how that's gone. i've not really kept track of. we've had a few members on the projects i've been on that have, you know, gotten connected job opportunities. i don't know about government job opportunities, but and certainly they put some job opportunities ups like explicitly.

unknown speaker  20:33  
i don't know. okay.

"," 20:44  
oh, i don't think we do that.

so, i mean, if we were gonna do that example might be helpful. but i don't know if that's something the core team wants to do. i mean, this might be na, but i'll just say, i don't know. how about that.

"," 21:25  
ah, recruiting

unknown speaker  21:28  
the core team?

 21:31  
i don't know, there might have been a question that covered that i don't have a good short term memory. so

it's fine to translate to bad long term memory too. but,

unknown speaker  21:41  
um,

 21:44  
for projects, like, i don't know if examples, but like, maybe examples, but of exam examples of like, specific tasks, because we're always missing skills in our projects. and so, i mean, recruiting in general, or like, avenues to recruiting for projects as well would be really

useful, like examples of like,

like, job postings, like how to write those and, and like, what you could put on those that would find you to people you're looking for, like, i could use a ton

of those for, like, different nuances.

unknown speaker  22:26  
we're looking for,

unknown speaker  22:29  
um,

 22:32  
and also where to post and stuff like that. and like examples of specific, like, there was a journey map example. and i found that useful. there was a project canvas example somewhere, but i lost it. and i wanted to look at it. so i don't know if that was useful or not, but had potential to be useful. shoot, i need to fill up the canvas. oh, my god.

dying? i'm

sorry. um,

yeah. um,

so examples.

i'm gonna say this, i know, there's nowhere to put it. i'm like, examples can be great. they take a lot of

unknown speaker  23:28  
extra energy.

 23:34  
mentoring, and like human connection would be a lot more useful. but that's not always possible. and i realized that and this kind of documentation can help when that isn't available. and that's, and that's very cool, too. but, um,

anything else asked about?

you know, what i would say examples of how to deal with code of conduct violations. not because i've noticed anything wrong, but because

i'm not sure. like some of the things that are being said that when when introducing the code of conduct make me think like, how are they handling these situations, because i'm not sure that that is the most effective way to put that when you're announcing them. right. and so maybe when they're handling them anyway.

unknown speaker  24:48  
other things

 24:58  
such a big ecosystem. like what i'm thinking of is all kinds of interconnected? like, how do you support projects that are lacking skills? right, that are lacking the needs that they have?

and that goes a bit to recruiting because there's not enough of the core team to do it.

yeah, some of it's about growth.

like, how do you support growth? not how do you grow? but how do you support growth? as as the brigade changes? and how do you how do you? how is being a small brigade in a rural area different from being a big brigade in an

urban area? and?

unknown speaker  25:59  
yeah.

 26:03  
and when you do need to reassess x, y, or z.

anyway, those are some thoughts.

 26:23  
it's an i don't know, but

i don't know.

but, but but it's not like constructing the code of congress comm code of conduct. like it doesn't need i don't think we needed an example of what a code of conduct looks like. it's more an example. maybe we might need an example of how to, like in force, a code of conduct, and how to handle and how to, like, present a code of conduct as it were.

 27:06  
okay. i don't remember. so in that case, good question. and i don't know, but maybe

i have my questions.

maybe i don't know. covers that.

 27:24  
and i wish i wish i had like 15 more options for answers.

 27:36  
mean, can there be like, a? i think so. but i don't know. or i don't think so. but

yeah, it's like, i have suspicions. i don't know.

 28:02  
so like, if this is, if this is a question or that is being asked of a core team member, then i think kind of the presentation of these possible answers. is sufficient? possibly, if this is being asked of a regular member? yeah, i think this lends itself to answers from regular members.

 28:35  
i mean, first of all, you don't need the i don't need an example. and i will need an example in the future if it's not a core team member, that just kind of yeah, mixes up, like, and then i'm answering questions about projects, not my brigade, because yes, i'd like an example of this for my project. but my answer is not about my brigade. it's about my project.

unknown speaker  28:56  
and

 29:00  
so that's what those make me think of. okay, it's more like, i think my, you know, core team is an exam an example this might be useful to the core team, you know what i mean? like, yeah, or i think this and i think that or from what i've seen, it's not like yes, we do or don't, right, i mean, some people will be like, i have an opinion and for some things, i have an opinion but like for a lot of things. it's like from the outside it looks like this right? yeah. and i'm and i'm someone who knows what's going on with the core team a little better and i've been around a lot longer than a lot of other members in my brigade. so i would see other members of my brigade being much more unsure and you getting a lot of i don't knows, which might not be super useful. i don't know. maybe you find i don't know super useful. but if you if you create these as statements in this way, you're only going to you're going i suspect you will get a lot of items notice unless people are really sure about their answer.

 30:14  
or very opinionated. okay. so but you might not get royalties where people go. i think we do, but it's none of my business. right? so you'll miss out on those pieces, which may not be a big deal. or it may, and on what you're trying to assess,

"," 32:25  
yeah, i don't know how much time we have. but

unknown speaker  32:41  
um, is that a practice?

 32:55  
this is for obrigado. sorry, sorry.

this is project so hang on. just do the first one. first of all, okay.

does my brigade practice these? no?

no, i think running meetings might be one. okay. so

unknown speaker  33:24  
for effective practices.

 33:41  
this is mostly experiences from my project. so i'm hesitant to

unknown speaker  33:53  
say these. but

 33:59  
now, i don't know if i have other ones for brigade wide things. so i will think a little bit more. some of the things we've talked about.

 34:46  
so yeah, some of those don't count anymore because they were project focused. and i keep forgetting that we're not talking about projects because that's where my head is that okay, so um, how about examples from a projects sound like from not other projects other like,

organizations?

 35:19  
because we're trying to find effective practices, right.

 35:47  
i would want to question that a little, because there are ways like that i'm not on my core team here in the brigade, but i am part of the administration team in a different project in a different organization. and i think they have some practices that are very useful.

 36:04  
but that's okay. we don't have to go over those.

 36:14  
let's start with exploring coordinate with project managers. like we've been trying out a few different ways to get the core team connected with project managers and vice versa to express to kind of have more of a back and forth instead of a top down.

 36:43  
well, project managers, we have a small repo where we've been collecting ideas for good project management, and some of that has involved, like, how we might try communicating and like collaborating with the core team. but i don't think we have good documentation on

unknown speaker  36:58  
it. okay,

 37:25  
i would say one closest to one.

 37:49  
wow, i personally would love all that as a project manager. um, i don't know if the core team wants that. so i don't know how to answer that question as a non core team members. so if you're expecting to be interviewing core team members, then i'm not a good person to answer.

 38:12  
yes, as a pm.

 38:31  
ah, probably talked to me. as for questions, maybe sad. i mean, we don't have documentation. so yeah, it would be it would be talked to us, right.

 39:12  
i wish i could go back to the thing of like examples, because sharing the load, like spreading the load would be one that i would be like, this is an example possibly to add for the core team. so or maybe like collective decision making from not collective decision making but like, cool, like? yeah, i don't know. anyway, um, so as a project. okay. so i think running meetings, more efficient. more. i think they run meetings pretty well, like the actual, like, beginning of the

like the intro meeting, right.

does that make sense? yeah. the like, pre orientation and orientation, like the start of the meetup.

 40:11  
oh, i haven't no idea. um, they at least have the website and the powerpoint. and i think, honestly, that might be able to be used with another by another brigade without extra consultation or context.

 40:27  
because the powerpoint presentation basically walks you through it.

 40:43  
you know, i personally am do not want to organize

unknown speaker  40:50  
the process at all.

unknown speaker  40:53  
enough trouble my team?

 40:59  
um, look at the powerpoint presentation, which i believe is at the repo. but you might ask that. so you might ask that where the powerpoint presentation is. good question. i like this. how do you follow up? i love that question. and that is one of my favorite questions. okay. put a little circle around it.

 41:45  
the one that's my favorite is collection decision making as a group, but that is only for my project. so i would not say, okay, okay, practice.

 42:04  
oh, i do have documentation for it. and i'm not sure if it could be i think for it could be used by another group with a short summary of the process. okay, and i can try and give you

the link, or

 42:32  
what kind of document this is for collective decision making, which we don't always do. sometimes we do more top down decision making process. but

unknown speaker  42:44  
let's see.

unknown speaker  42:51  
here is this.

unknown speaker  43:00  
okay, maybe it's in the wiki.

 43:09  
so here's a quick reference guide. and

there should be information linked up there

that you can take a look at. and also bonnie did an interview with me about it. so that up to that that by itself, combined with this documentation might be enough without a summary. and i'm not complete, but that's a lot to go through. so

and that's a very short summary of the process. and then there's

more documentation that is linked there.

 43:52  
that is what i would say,

 44:00  
not unless you feel it needs clarification. if it needs if it could use some love that you if you look at it and go, this could be improved, then it would be totally fine, but

i'm happy with how it is right now.

 45:09  
i'm a team of volunteers slash team lead.

classico project manager.

project code, you know, a volunteer slash project lead. i might say slash team lead. i don't know, man, i never held position. like the other day, my job title be i'm like the boss the boss should be. it depends what kind of job you want, right? if you want yeah, management job doing an administrative title and one. if you want to be down in the dirt with the yeah, digging the holes, then, which i totally approve of them. you want that kind of title. but anyway, carry on. roughly, that's the thing. i don't want the project management. that's not where yeah, so like, i also have stayed there. but

 46:18  
let's say it's like,

seven per project or more. and there are like, six or seven projects. six times seven is

unknown speaker  46:36  
boring.

 46:40  
so i would say around 15, maybe?

also not my wheelhouse, but

i guess, i don't know. 40 or 5040 to 50.

 46:56  
and it might be yeah.

 47:05  
well, one person from the very start, which i think is like eight or nine years, maybe 10s. like, i forgot

 47:14  
because i though he sort of stepped down. harlin. and so it was sort of yeah, harlan. yeah.

 47:25  
oh, i would be so interested to hear his because it's private. yeah, i would have been really interested to hear his thoughts. but that's, that's totally yeah, that's fine.

 47:47  
he's a very forgiving person about that kind of stuff. no worries. um, yeah. and, and some little less time, right. so i don't know, matt's been there at least like, like, three or four years. like, i think he's been part of the core team longer. so some people are newer, some people are have been there since inception. so. okay. uh, my role? how long is core team? then there was another question.

 48:33  
okay. is have you seen the bop before? ramy tend to three years? because it really it's not like, we just got new members in the core team. had i seen the bot before brigade

unknown speaker  48:48  
organizations,

unknown speaker  48:49  
proposal.

 48:55  
brigade organizers playbook? no, i haven't. you might want to consider putting bob in the chat. and it's and what it means if you're gonna refer back to it.

 49:37  
what were other questions that you asked because i don't remember them?

 49:45  
like, like you were like, how many? how long the core team members been core team members and what's your role? and there were a couple other questions that you mentioned in there that i don't think i've answered yet.

 50:38  
so i don't think this is ready for members. so like, if this were just a survey, i would be hesitant about giving it if i were a project corps member. i'd be a bit hesitant to pass it out. other than like, i'd love to sport code for america. so you know, i could do it. but i think if and if this is if this is all that there's energy for then sure. like, right, like, if this is the only thing, then we can go out? and people can answer it as they will. but

it would be nice if it were if it if it was geared towards members, if if i was going to i were going to present this to other members, it would be nice if it was geared towards members, right.

 51:39  
as in its current state, if needed, yes. and otherwise now. you know, like, it depends how much how much it is like, right, if you all don't have the capacity to change it. and if this would be useful for you, then yes, i want to help this project move forward. right. yeah. but i, as a member would find this frustrating to take and frustrating and confusing to take. okay, by myself, like without you there. so i guess that's my feedback. i can't answer that question. like, yeah, it's, it's okay to put people through frustration. sometimes. that's okay.

 52:18  
people have to live with frustration at times in their lives

 52:23  
yeah. okay. so i would i would put the like, how long have you been with your brigade at the very start? because if i had only been with my brigade for two months or something, i'd be like, how are they judging these questions? because they, i hope they're not weighing them at the same weight that they would weigh someone who's been here for like, three years. yeah.

so

i would be much more hesitant about my questions. if i didn't know that you were going to find out that you were going to ask how long i've been with the brigade, huh? okay. personally,

 53:16  
he already knows about

 53:25  
and harlan, and maybe matt,

 53:31  
matt carlin. yeah, maybe alex, but i'm not sure he's into it. i'm not sure he's into the process of things. so but maybe i mean, i could be surprised. and it wouldn't be nice to like, include him. you know what i mean? yeah. just leave him out because of assumptions. exactly.

 53:58  
i don't have their info. if you want it, that's fine. but like, basically, ask all the core team members, right? if you're asking about the the issues with like, that they're trying to solve with the brigade, then i would say, you're like, which of the core team would be interested in doing this? i'm like, i would be interested in all the core team doing this. so i'll let you know. yeah. like i'd say just ask them. and if they're interested, they'll you know, i don't know if anyone who would be offended by the question.

 54:41  
have already told you all the things okay, item down, then it's too late, because i

 54:56  
oh, this was interesting. thanks. i think that's sort of

 55:12  
how do i follow up?

unknown speaker  55:17  
on the results of this

 55:28  
well, i mean, i can't imagine

how my results would create any specific effect. so like the aggregated responses is kind of what i'm interested in. i mean, if my if my responses have some effect on the situation, that'd be nice to know. but i'm kind of more interested in the project as a whole.

 55:51  
okay, we'll just add that as one of my questions that i asked. so follow up and blah, blah, blah.

 56:04  
partially public things brigade, but not named of interviewee supposed to come from like a staff national judge comes with including aggregate data and findings a little port?

unknown speaker  56:17  
delete my answer.

 56:26  
if i could have talked, it talked about these answers with my core team members first, then i would say one,

unknown speaker  56:35  
but

 56:39  
since i didn't haven't gotten to talk to them about all these issues before, then the answers for okay.

no worries. i mean, i mean, look.

like if, if the names of the brigades and the individuals was not disclosed, then i would happy be happy for code for america staff and national advisory council to take a look. but i imagine if that's the case, then it's not any better than having the aggregated data.

 57:13  
okay, is there no names or brigade names associated with it? other than that, you can show it to who you want. right.

 57:27  
and that includes, and so that means that the answer about like, who else to contact? that would be private? yeah, that would be and and the answers about how long have you brigade members, have your core team members been? core team members would also be off limits? because there's not a lot of brigades that have been around that long. yeah, it really narrows it down.

 58:02  
um, the response? so how public do you want your answers to be made? i'm saying no names of anything? and also not that answer to that question or other questions that you find that reveal,

 58:20  
yeah, exactly. so not not answers that could lead to the identification of the brigades and people involved. if it's anonymized in that way, then i'm happy for code for america and for the neck to see it. you know, i don't know what good that does. and i'm happy. and i would love for it to be aggregate included in the aggregate data. so for for sure, if the if it's really anonymized, including that information that i just

unknown speaker  58:52  
described.

 58:57  
and otherwise, you know,

basically, with the caveats, that's all

 59:45  
i would, i would say, fully public includes named brigades and into i mean, i would say not public needs to include like all identifying information would be removed. right? because for me, it was like number of years that the corps members have been corps members. but for other brigades, that might be some other information that would reveal, right, that would reveal which brigade it is. mm hmm. but i think the answers need to be, like looked at to make sure that even ones that don't have names yeah. aren't revealing the brigade or the individual?

 1:00:46  
yeah, so for example, the the documentation, i added about making decisions, if it were combined with my other answers, all in one table, bro. then people would know who i am. yeah. right. like, you don't need my name there. you have the link to the repository that i've been contributing to. and i did a video on it. right. so like, if it's all if, if if it is kept in the same row as the rest of my answers, then i'm not my answers are not anonymous.

 1:01:51  
in cute too. nice to see you again.

yes.

 10:07  
yeah, i mean my only comment is just that i am not actually very familiar with the current game. organizers playbooks so, got my answers may not be best relative to that. there may be great examples in there for all i know. but yeah,

 10:40  
right, i'm just saying.

like i, i don't know,

let's just start i guess it may depend on how the questions are phrased.

"," 11:06  
okay. um. so, this is how i rank my need for a topic about this. yep. okay, great. um,

i would say, like,

yeah, maybe if three.

unknown speaker  11:31  
cool.

"," 11:49  
i would also.

i think i would make that.

yeah, i would, i would make that for.

"," 12:26  
yeah, that would be a five, or actually that'd be a six. okay.

no, no, sorry, five. i made too much. no.

"," 12:50  
three.

unknown speaker  12:51  
cool.

"," 13:11  
i think, three.

"," 13:38  
yeah. i

think too for that one.

unknown speaker  13:46  
cool.

"," 13:57  
that would be a three.

"," 14:10  
for.

"," 14:26  
six.

",," 14:47  
six. awesome.

"," 14:56  
um.

that's it for. cool.

"," 15:22  
um, i do three for that one.

"," 15:38  
five.

five.

"," 16:27  
one

"," 16:41  
six.

"," 16:56  
three.

"," 17:10  
also three.

"," 17:39  
yeah, i think,

collaborating with code for america projects.

 17:57  
know, like, collaborate with code for america projects for example, get your refund or

that sort of thing.

clear my record.

like the code for america headquarter decades. i mean navigate on projects.

 18:31  
their yeah their headquarters their their projects.

 18:50  
yeah.

a. i would say,

like,

sort of like contacting influencing and running for nec, which is the national advisory council.

 19:27  
that's okay, i just said it.

 19:37  
a key as a contacting influencing and running for the national advisory council. it's the group that represents the brigades at the national level. and it can be hard to figure out how to get, like, get them to. yeah, figure out how to, how to work with them. so

 20:07  
i think that's it. i think i'm good.

"," 20:47  
think about that a little bit.

yes.

 21:15  
yeah, that might be helpful.

 21:59  
um,

let's see, yeah so

says one thing i can think of.

yeah, i'm not sure. oh,

there's one more.

 23:10  
that's it.

 23:31  
yeah, so that's just about,

like,

get a you know brigade members to get to know each other like finding topics that are interesting and connect people even if they're not like on the same project. just making it kind of a place where people feel like they know other people, and they enjoy being there.

 24:42  
yes, not at all.

on the first item. oh cool.

 25:05  
know these are tracked like these are sort of like culture and practices that we have they're not written down. at least that i remember maybe, maybe somewhere but like not in a way that's useful for anybody else.

 25:51  
um,

yeah maybe q&a. okay.

 26:26  
yeah, best to contact me.

i also think you know we don't have like a ton necessarily to share but just add if others, start sharing. and, you know, if it's also kind of a question of like does do others want this information cuz i yeah i don't want to share it, like, just because it came up on this interview right, i want to like take the time if someone's actually interested or wants to use it.

 27:41  
yeah. yeah.

 27:53  
yeah.

so that one is like just barely documented so let me see what's the system. i would say, like,

that's too

 28:15  
like a google doc. okay.

 28:37  
i think feedback and formatting.

 29:08  
um, i so i don't

i don't think so i don't think it's public.

unknown speaker  29:18  
please.

unknown speaker  29:21  
double check.

 29:36  
yeah, i don't think it's probably not, i'll keep looking but i'm gonna.

 30:01  
no i don't think so.

 30:25  
um, i am

the interim executive director.

 30:55  
that's always a hard question because active means different things.

yeah, i would say,

like, 25.

 31:25  
two years.

 31:40  
like i've heard of it but i haven't opened it.

 32:48  
i guess i would be, i would like take a look at it existed. but i don't like don't make it for me, i don't, i don't think that we have many members who are very interested in resources from code for america, actually, and so i wouldn't. yeah, i don't i'm not, i'm not voting like to for people to do work to make that exist because i'm worried it won't be used, but if it exists then i will share it, because i think it could be useful.

 33:44  
maybe where if, you know, we decided to do that, then, then we can ask, then i, i don't think. yeah, there's anyone that like, we need to reach out to you right now.

 34:13  
no, i don't think anyone else is really

like that active with code for america stuff.

 34:35  
no, i think that's good. all right, cool.

 35:03  
um,

i guess i don't understand. number three, so is that just close to code for america staff, like with my name and brigade, or

 35:28  
yeah, i'll say four. okay.

 35:56  
thanks, youtube. all right, bye bye.

all right, bye.

oh, is my audio. is it coming through.

unknown speaker  21:01  
yes. okay.

 21:20  
yes, i have my video off, i am kind of in shambles. right now, was video necessary for this interview with the boc project voip project, however, prefer.

 21:47  
i am good, i'm

looking at the email that i think maryann barian emailed saying like, have a list of documentation and processes prepared. and i am fully embarrassed because i don't, we don't have a list of documentation.

 23:24  
yep, that's perfectly fine.

 23:51  
well, i think what i'm gonna say is, i have no problem with anything being used, but i guess we'll see after that.

 24:39  
yes, i am part of open austin.

 24:53  
yep, that's me.

 25:17  
excuse me, um,

your audio is breaking up a bit. i don't know, i, i'm in an airbnb, it might be my bandwidth but i just wanted to flag that for you.

",," 27:00  
hosting hack nights. um, i think we do that well. that would be a one.

 27:21  
it's like if we do it well but there's room for improvement,

 28:03  
there's no option for i know what it is but we choose not to do it.

 28:17  
sure, we are having, we are having. we. yes, we are having capacity challenges, just with the size of our core team being very small. i would say to people, two regular contributors that a core team, and three other semi regular but that's not consistent enough to be able to plan a larger event and also have that go seamlessly. so there's one aspect of like core team capacity, and then there's the other aspect of. i'm

unknown speaker  28:57  
just

 28:58  
how do i phrase this

solidifying our offering as a brigade. so open austin. one is a small brigade and two has only recently had regular hack nights or project nights. as of 20, during the calendar year of 2019 project nights were once a month. and something called our speaker series was also once a month. and during 2020, we changed that model, drop the speaker series and said hey, we're gonna go all in on these project sites, and well as all in as you can get with project nice two times a month. so that has been a change that we're putting our efforts into we want to see that experiment through covid aside, that's kind of thrown a wrench in, but to introduce a lot of changes. didn't to introduce a lot of changes to our community. um, in terms of types of programming that we offer large events, etc didn't make sense because we're one trying to build our brand and our reputation and gain solidity in terms of again what we offer and to in terms of just core team capacity.

unknown speaker  30:32  
so that's why that's the answer.

 30:58  
i have been to national day before so before open austin i was part of code for boston and i. my heart aches a lot because, at times i wish. yo i wish we could be a big brigade but obviously that doesn't happen it's not like today where a small upgrade even tomorrow where it's like, there has to be stepping stones to growth. so no i don't like desire that right now. i also

unknown speaker  31:31  
that

unknown speaker  31:33  
i would want

 31:34  
our brigade to be very solid in terms of like the larger community and in terms of the core team first before like considering having a civic day a national day of civic action, and then i would want to lead a discussion with the our core team around the question of what are the goals of national day because it's cool to have like national a, i know cfa large puts out a lot of support, in terms of running it. but what is, what is the point of our brigade hosting it, what are our follow on so that is it just to spur excitements. do we want to channel that in a specific way so even like we can put in a lot of effort into like creating the events and facilitating the event but i think the follow through is equally, if not more important.

 32:41  
all right, because you have to do your ux research. yes, i don't need an example. cool. okay.

 33:07  
um, i don't need an example. yeah, i don't need it, or is the question like to clarify the process of "," 33:40  
yeah, i'd like i'd like that. and then i'd like to focus on like the discovery of what partnerships. like, who do you focus on. that's so

"," 34:09  
would you define this community partners.

 34:47  
got it, okay so like specifically are saying like a stakeholder, that is early in government. okay. i'm cultivating those, i would say let me look at this scale again.

i would say a three. mmm. cool. yeah, that's very cool, but with a caveat of like cold partnerships. these community orgs in the wild, we would need examples, those that we like

are warmer. not necessarily.

",," 36:01  
before for, who would the audience be, like, would it be educating the partners or

 36:10  
for our brigade. okay.

it's a three, two and a half, three.

",,," 36:52  
of five. let's go at six to be safe.

",," 37:21  
those were not worth

five.

",," 38:13  
are you broke up there. could you repeat, please.

"," 38:21  
let me type it to make sure

unknown speaker  38:26  
is that right. that's right.

 38:29  
yeah. ah. three.

"," 38:48  
again, asking who the audience is with the audience be like brigade at large or specifically the core team, or third yeah

 39:22  
that's a wide question so i would say like on the core team, it would be a one, but for if we would need a project or needs a strong word if there was this project that are brigade hosts that we would like folks in other brigades to glom on to that would be a three. but if there are other brigades projects that we want to glom on to that would be a two. so like, that's the whole spectrum.

"," 40:22  
okay. i'm.

three.

"," 40:39  
i see, um, before that let me expound on the previous one a bit so a guide for making open source projects replicable by other brigades like that could be useful, but i think what we desire, what i've heard other core team members mentioned in the past is that we want to replicate other's projects, we don't necessarily want our stuff replicable we're just not in the state to like, look at our things. let's share. so i would say for that second one that would definitely be a five. but for, for us to share out not as critical for us to copy and absorb that has a higher, higher need.

 41:32  
and for running remote project lights, that is a, what is it we do this well have one.

"," 41:50  
how does how to how do i remote.

i think i don't understand the question.

 42:14  
i, personally, i would say, a sex. first, but i guess we are, we are having an individual conversation so that's what it is.

"," 42:49  
three

as well i'm, i'm guessing that. i mean, we have a jobs channel. but that's the lowest effort of of advertising and connecting people, so i'm curious what other ways that are more high touch and more impactful could be.

",," 43:36  
what is the question was like what a guide to using those services were there, or

 43:51  
yeah, i'm too.

 44:18  
yeah. could you repeat back to me which topics i said were four or five or six, and let me snowball off.

 45:11  
cool. thank you. um, so let me think. i would be curious how other brigades communicate and socialized our code of conduct, because i at our remote project nights feel like i'm saying the same scripts for announcements over and over and i'm lucky. here's our code of conduct. don't be a jerk. basically, would you get. i don't know if it gets too repetitive for me because my ears are attached to my head and i have to hear it every two weeks, or if it is indeed a repetitive theme to hear for community members at large. so i'd be curious about how other brigades socialize. in less of the head and the lighter manner.

and then steps to

actually prompt action. so, there's putting myself in the shoes of a community member. i'd feel very safe and welcome that a code of conduct exists. but if i'm a new community member or a prospective rather the entity member. i would say there's a big jump between knowing it exists and actually acting upon and filing a report. so open austin has an anonymous report form, there is zero incidents. i could be optimistic and think. indeed, there are zero instances in which shady things have happened. or i could be realistic and be like, well, i think people aren't using it, the easier the past path of lesser resistance that suggest letting the issue, go under the rug right. so, how do we encourage that not only how do we deal with violations. and i'm like, specifically looking at the letter of the question, but the holistic spirit of how do we also encourage the adoption and internalization of that code of conduct. i would be very curious if there were different ways. and maybe there aren't in the remote setting maybe it's just like you got to be heavy handed,

i don't know.

 47:45  
and for d ai.

unknown speaker  47:49  
i

 47:51  
would be curious what

axes of diversity, are being considered. that's kind of a tough one because i know the project is about creating those assays like seeing what people are saying, but i am specifically interested in gender diversity and the skill set diversity. i want the p not the only woman in the room every two weeks, that would be ideal. um, and

i wants. um,

i want sound sounds very heavy handed. we think of a way to phrase this one a way to encourage putting the user first, which could either take the form of having more user researchers, or having developers skill up in those areas. that's a tough question. i don't know how to force volunteers to do anything, which could also be another guide in and of itself. so just to summarize axes of diversity and like motivating

community members beyond

what they.

there's like what like a user thinks that they might want something. but that doesn't necessarily address the, the root cause or the root desire, that's what i'm trying to get that.

like they think they might want to skill up in

typescript very specific, but maybe the root is actually or the underlying desire is to skill up in like achieving goals i don't know. achieving user outcomes.

 50:00  
diversity in those aspects, the brexit baksa. one of the topics that you had that you had mentioned that i had mentioned. so there's gender skill set in austin, we are pretty weird. the city is very white. but our brigade tends to draw racial diversity, for whatever reason, um,

yeah i don't i don't further i'm

 50:37  
i feel good on that part.

 50:50  
um, that sounds good,

or as that's all off the top of my head. okay, i am not writing anything down, so if i once i get the transcript and then i'm like, oh, okay.

"," 51:42  
no.

 52:03  
a xesc

 52:53  
uh, you're breaking up a bit. so, how the brigade fits into the national level.

 53:05  
i see, i see.

 53:10  
okay, i am the captain.

 53:18  
we're not doing yes nose anymore. on.

 53:33  
how are you defining active members.

 53:46  
okay, our, our project knights yield 20 to 25 people every two weeks. but contributors outside of those, i'd say asynchronous contributors go from 23 to 27 total.

 54:17  
yeah because some people just don't come subproject knights, but they like contribute regularly. outside of

 54:38  
could you put that in the chat, please. oh, sorry. no worry.

what a question. i'm a year and a half.

 55:33  
or will be like knowledge of the bob.

unknown speaker  55:37  
okay, the first.

 56:24  
oh, okay. hang on. switch.

unknown speaker  56:33  
no. all right.

 57:15  
yeah that's inaccurate deduction. yeah, i'd say the documentation in our brigade is very light and if anything i am the one who documents. hmm. and,

 57:32  
yeah, i'd like it to be distributed, it is not distributed. so, that's also why like the interest in. why answered no for. do i want soft assault service option like, there aren't gonna be responses.

 58:01

three.

unknown speaker  15:35  
three.

unknown speaker  15:36  
okay, so

"," 15:55  
um, i think that remote work is obviously something that's happening everywhere now. so i would, i would, i don't have a specific so i mentioned you know the difference between hacknight when it's remote and not remote i think we've managed to some but i think that that whole area is something that even after things go back to normal is something that would be good to still have as an option and learn about how to find those who are very sick, learning from those who are very successful so you did ask about remote but i would say, digging into this more, because i do think that keeping remote possibilities is going to be useful for everyone. yeah, that makes sense.

 16:57  
no i the only topic that i can't remember maybe you did ask recruiting new volunteers did you maybe you did cover it and i missed it i'm a little tired.

unknown speaker  17:13  
oh no i

 17:27  
i guess it's recruiting and maintaining volunteer routines. i don't know if that's the right word. so you did talk about creating a core team which definitely makes sense. but i would also like an example or like, you know, successful ways to or for outreach to find those people, and especially now it's harder because of the remote situation. so yeah, strategies for that or.

 18:19  
let's let's keep going cuz uh you know i keep thinking of things and it's, i will let you know after we talk more if there was something that wasn't covered. yeah definitely likes chatting now.

 18:53  
okay, i'll try to wait.

"," 19:25  
can i say i don't know.

 19:30  
let's do one for now. one,

 19:37  
yeah i i need to spend time thinking, but i feel like there are things that can be shared, i just, you know.

 20:12  
i take it back i don't feel like i have enough information. just from what i've done so i don't want to.

 20:30  
i know there are, so i don't have a. i have to go look in the templates and i don't have enough knowledge, i'm sorry. no yes i don't want to speak to something that i don't actually know that well it's like my hunch is yes but i don't have the information to like,

 20:55  
let's let's keep it with no for now.

 21:17  
yeah, that will probably help with that so i i am i am a. i am a project manager to one of the projects. and that's pretty recent so and before then i was, you know, contributor, mostly did coding on projects. so i'm like i've been become become more exposed to a lot of things. more recently, and i think that's why nick who couldn't didn't have the time he's there brigade captain asked me if i can chat with you so yeah so that's that's where i'm at. i've been like taking a little more initiatives lately so slightly more of a lead. but yeah.

 22:25  
i think right now active members. roughly would be 10. and there's a lot of lurkers you know and people that kind of show up and. so, like a little more active people that are slightly more engaged, i would say they're roughly 10, i think,

 23:01  
i, a few years i'm not sure exactly.

unknown speaker  23:07  
okay, that's fine.

 23:12  
i think it's been always nick i think he's, he was like the one that started it so yeah and it's like, i think four or five years but i'm not sure.

 24:51  
um, i, if i wouldn't be happy to run it by nick and see if this is something he wants to do or not, like it's his decision so if that's something you can still send the information about then it might be useful.

 25:21  
i don't know.

unknown speaker  25:23  
yeah.

 25:33  
you might have i mean he he's juggling so many things. and so you might actually find time just. i know that this wiki, he said that you just can't squeeze it in which is why he asked me to chat with you.

 26:12  
i can't think of anything you, i don't know if it's true you should have asked that we earlier you asked me about like the example thing like what what are the things maybe would be helpful so i as i like become more active and you know, being a little bit more of a leader. and i'm this i'm probably not the first one. but how to bet like learning a good way to balance the census of volunteer based, and a lot of people want to help, but then you know this, it's a time commitment sometimes and also how to what are good ways to balance and one hand saying okay you're a volunteer we're not, you know, we're not your boss. but on the other hand, finding a way to make them commit, either. i don't know, like, just because it is very hard to to get stuff done when people are not consistent, and obviously the core team part is very important as well but just, just the whole managing volunteers. i feel like that's a whole, it's an art of its own like it's a whole thing. it's very different from a workplace so. and it's not like open source is one thing but actually having a project you know on partners and like, that's, that's different. so,

unknown speaker  27:35  
yeah.

 27:36  
and i'm babbling a little bit but i just, i'm finding myself thinking about how do you make this work better. yeah. how do you keep these people interested but then also not overwork them and like, yeah.

 28:00  
well they did. and then, so there were at least three people that was like the core leadership. one of them was nick. he co, there is a co captain, but he's like, and i'm not really sure how he's involved he's not a developer he's like helps with other stuff, which i'm not, i don't know. but and then as the pandemic hit the two others, each one of them for personal reasons have to kind of step down. so it was, in terms of the kind of more leadership and core it was him and then there were there were me and another person that were very active still and then one of them moved to europe. so that's kind of where we are. and he was saying i'll still work with you because i'm remote and but you know it's okay so far he wasn't able to get back to being involved so that's kind of where things are at from that perspective so it's,

 29:26  
but yeah, and i think there's a lot of pluses and i feel like specifically here, it was less about the reason the remote aspect of things, it was more just like all these three things related to the pandemic happened, and they had to like he moved because of that and then the other two had personnel issues they had to attend to. so it's like, it's related to the pandemic more. in this case, it just yeah and and yeah the remote stuff is challenging but i've done it for some time so i do think there are a lot of benefits so right. being able to only get the benefits from it and use the in person and like combining all that could be really amazing. but yeah, easy to do.

 30:58  
um, so i'm going to be difficult again i'm sorry. so, if it's, you know, including you know who we are like the big eight it does it isn't going to show like i mean if i said we don't have examples we don't have anything to offer versus,

 31:18  
i need examples for everything because it's also my own point of view it's like not my own experience and i'm not like entirely in leadership and i want it to be public if it's helpful but i don't want to have anyone feel like i misrepresented them if that makes sense.

 34:17  
so i, i mean i'm more, much more comfortable sonny's to be i don't like being, you know, i prefer to be anonymous but if it is better for you if you find value in this not being anonymous then i will overcome my, my discomfort. so, i don't know what the reason is that there is a need for if it's more for the person that is quoted, or is it actually better when it's named like do you find that it's kind of good to have things, not anonymous if that makes sense.

 35:00  
so let's let's uh let's just use my name it's fine and we're probably not going to have that much. anyway, so i'm okay with it.

unknown speaker  35:11  
yeah.

 35:12  
and you're probably gonna let me know for right thank you

 36:34  
have their name on it so yeah i just you guys so it's so good.

 37:13  
you for interviewing.

unknown speaker  37:16  
yeah. have a good day. all right.

i am yeah, patrick i run code for denver.

 1:10  
it's nice today it snowed all day yesterday. well, half the day yesterday, but it's classic caught out of weather where it snows, and then it's like 70 degrees or 60 degrees and sunny and so it all melts off so that's kind of cool. yeah, yeah, it's nice.

 1:34  
yeah, i mean, i've lived here a long time and like it's changed a lot in the last seven years.

 1:44  
yeah. i grew up out here my family's out here, went to school.

unknown speaker  1:48  
okay.

 1:52  
it's the shabbiness wore off, a long time ago. that's so

unknown speaker  1:55  
funny. huh. okay,

 1:56  
it's still really good it's still good city.

 4:15  
cool, and good.

"," 5:04  
actually, you know what i should probably change that i'm sorry because they should probably change that to like a three. we do traditional like in person hacknight really well, but we do online hack nights, not so well. so, gotcha in the new world where we're not not experts at it,

unknown speaker  5:24  
that's for sure.

 5:30  
okay well pretty new.

"," 5:38  
um, i think i will do i think i'll do three as well. we've done a couple of those. but it always feels pretty disorganized.

"," 6:04  
no worries, a five.

unknown speaker  6:07  
all righty.

 6:09  
actually, gets a six on that sorry i just saw that that was a little bit stronger. yeah, we always need help with that. okay, thanks dad i think we have not been able to grow because of that. oh wow, okay.

"," 6:42  
i'm probably a two on that one.

 6:50  
we just, that's kind of, it kind of just rolls along we're a holder brigade we've been around for like seven years i think and so we have built a good name recognition stuff so it just kind of

"," 7:09  
yeah, let's do a three on that i could see us possibly using something like,

 7:19  
i could see as possibly using an example on that. yeah, we, we sometimes have the talent to do that in house and sometimes don't.

"," 7:44  
probably a one. we've been like again. older brigade, so we've been doing it for a while.

"," 7:58  
think, a three would probably be good to go with that other one where it's like, if. sometimes we have the talent to do that. and sometimes we don't. so having an example when we don't have the talent is probably really helpful.

"," 8:25  
think three. we've never had a code of conduct violation luckily crossing our fingers here. but um, i think an example would be helpful always to know what to do because i don't think that we would necessarily know what to do right away.

 8:47  
i said that i actually, i said a three but i think a four is probably

unknown speaker  8:56  
your answer. sorry,

 8:57  
that was the best, that's probably a way better.

"," 9:12  
i think i will say, five. we've had very different core teams over the past few years, but i wish i had no, i wish i knew a very effective way to do it.

 9:29  
we every time we try and change it up it just, it's like it feels like we're reinventing the wheel. okay.

"," 9:41  
se six. we have never even really considered that as a thing that we need to do and probably limited us quite a bit.

"," 10:10  
it'd be nice to see that but i think we oftentimes do that for our project.

"," 10:30  
i'd say for. okay. he we currently have our fundraising needs met, but. but if we were to ever expand, we want to do that or if we ever lost some of our fundraising, we'd want to do that.

 10:47  
we actually just fundraise for food. okay, space, and those kinds of things. we don't pay anyone, everyone to volunteer but in from a long term partner of ours to pretty much like provide food, drinks, those kinds of things when we're doing in person hacknight. it's been weird because we had, you know, a good funding, good funding stream that, then we didn't actually use this year. we also fund projects like if someone needs a domain name or some server space or something like that we'll fund projects with that money. and then any other like supplies that we use so i know that about like a backpack backpack for all of our stuff too so that we just had like, one thing that everyone could carry around.

 11:55  
yeah, totally. i mean like pizzas maybe not the best use of it, but we've never switched and i think that goes to that other question around having a strategic plan for brigade like, how would we move that money from like providing pizza so that people will come. if we still believe that that's something that people need to come like a free pizza incentive, or if we should use money in a different way.

 12:38  
totally cool i'm here. so,

"," 14:22  
the other thing that might be happening is they might be connected to your phone from your phone. i usually do that by just turning off the bluetooth on my phone.

unknown speaker  14:35  
are you talking to me.

 14:36  
oh, sorry. no clara girlfriend.

 15:32  
what if you need to take a break or something i'm totally amenable to that don't.

 15:46  
i think we'll do five. okay. yeah, we, we use a bunch of different tools that other brigade, don't, i think, and, but i think it would have been good to know what everyone's using all the time. okay.

"," 16:10  
i think we'll do four. okay.

"," 16:24  
we'll do five for that. our members are usually just code for denver members

"," 16:47  
think. we don't don't do a lot of that or we don't. it doesn't feel like priority. okay.

"," 17:06  
yeah, let's go ahead and do five on that. going back to what we said earlier about hacknight.

"," 17:30  
let's say five. okay, struggled with a lot. okay.

"," 17:40  
i'm probably one.

unknown speaker  17:44  
okay,

unknown speaker  17:44  
cool. we do that already.

 17:50  
i don't but i used to. oh, we're getting nonprofit that's government adjacent, so we do have a. we do have like a jobs channel in our discord that we really try and push people into.

unknown speaker  18:03  
that's awesome.

"," 18:11  
um, i think we'll do three. okay.

"," 18:37  
so the one thing that i think would be really helpful is know how to word it and maybe you can help me figure out how to word it but it's like the interaction between the national code for america group, and your brigade right like we very rarely understand how that relationship works like what we can ask for or what we can ask for, or what we should expect or not expect so maybe it's just like expectations of working with the national network or then or code for america proper.

unknown speaker  19:12  
mm hmm. it's good.

 19:38  
i think i would kind of highlight go back to one of the ones that we said before the government and partnerships, what i would highlight that is like one of the most important parts that i think we're missing the network that national network has access to. so like, they have this to government people, they're like, for instance in my state. there are three fellowship positions in code for america fellowships positions being placed this year with three different local governments. all of them in the backyard of brigades that i don't believe the brigades have real connections. so,

 20:28  
yeah, i mean like so. like for instance we have code for denver code for boulder which is 30 minutes north and onze which is like an hour and a half north and code for denver, there's a fellowship position in adams county, right now, which is a suburb of denver, it's like, right next door. and i've never seen, i've never even talked to adam county adams county government people never even did they have an interest in code for america or heard that they have a need for technolog technology solutions, yet. they're so embedded with code for america that they actually have a fellowship in place there. and so, like, again, government partnerships feel like they're being held by the code for america brigade. gotcha. and we're not getting like anything coming out. it's not fair. yeah, it's like come on please share it, share it out and also i'm sure code for america can't do everything and so like, why are we not being tapped.

unknown speaker  21:30  
right. okay,

 21:32  
i think, i think that i don't know how to explain that, better and the government partnerships things because it's like, i see this brigade organizer playbook being like this is how you form a relationship with governments, not this is how code for america can help you form relationships with governments or can help foster those relationships, themselves.

"," 22:22  
we did, cool.

 22:27  
yeah. in the earlier bit yeah okay yeah. oh,

 22:36  
yeah, yeah.

 22:53  
all right, sounds good. like there's another one i can't remember it, that i was going to talk about but we'll start with those three. okay.

 24:21  
starter projects.

 24:45  
let's do documents. okay.

 25:28  
don't think any of those lie to it. i think, well maybe user testing, we could say user testing.

 25:41  
yeah, i think, i think. so, basically, documentation is like how to start these like small single person or small team projects to get kind of involved in civic tech, and i think probably user testing would be a good way to do that but it's just hard to wrap my head around user testing because i think people will just look at it and see if they can do it right, like it's very it's not like an application it's like reading through the document and seeing if.

 26:14  
yeah, that's

 26:25  
um, no, i think the only other thing that would be interesting about it or would help would be kind of brainstorming, i guess, because we have these starter projects and they're all ideas, and i would, i'm sure there's more ideas of ways that people can contribute, we didn't come up with, so it'd be nice to flesh it out, even deeper, i guess.

 27:54  
yeah, verbally to set up a meeting with me, who created them.

 28:26  
so, i think, automated tool onboarding is a, maybe two, it's not very well documented.

unknown speaker  28:37  
okay.

 28:49  
yeah. i mean, yeah, a document of a process basically.

 29:00  
i think that won't be a lot harder so probably not because i can't think of much detail tool that was built, and then turn into a process, and the only people that know how it works are the people who built it. okay, so good for denver anymore, but who are, they're engaged a little bit so i think it would just be harder, we'd have to get our house in order before anyone can help us anything.

 29:42  
yeah. yeah, it's definitely like the idea is there we're using it, but it has it's hard to like build upon right now because of the limitations are brigade.

 30:05  
think they'd have to join code for number and experience, and then probably chat with me.

unknown speaker  30:12  
okay, i'm gonna put chat with you.

 30:14  
yeah, i think, the. we have a lot of leadership changes recently so, it sucks that i'm like the keeper of a lot of the knowledge right now. right, right. a lot of like breath on our leadership.

 30:32  
does, does.

 30:40  
yeah, i say, let's do. it's document and it's a form. so that was one of the options.

 30:52  
and i believe that it is a. let's say a four. i hesitate to say five it probably is. well drafted enough for someone else to just take and use and plug in their name instead of ours. but, um, but i think it'd be better used if it was a four with someone getting a little bit of an overview of how we use it first.

 31:35  
yeah, i think this is one that like i could just hand over and they could start clicking around and understanding it on their own, rather than me needing to walk them through it. this one's a little bit more self service, a little bit more well developed.

 32:00  
i did not okay. that's okay, we're trying to wrack my brain over, and i don't we did we're in the process of starting basically our own playbook or organization handbook, and that would be another one that i would consider putting on here but it's so nascent like we haven't even shared it with our brigade it's literally just the leadership doing it so it's hard to say, but maybe there's time to come back around. once that's actually, in effect, and working. okay.

 32:39  
i am the co organizer,

 32:55  
let's say, 30,

 33:10  
that's i i'd say three years, two years, three years.

 33:29  
i have yes, a long time ago.

 33:41  
i mean i think i looked at at once when i was like on boarded as a, as a captain, and then i've probably never looked at it again.

unknown speaker  33:51  
mm hmm. it's just a document really.

 34:21  
yeah i think that that's really really depend on who the other people are. so, for a new brigade, 10 100%, i'd have them go read it first new leadership 10 for new volunteers, zero. okay. no. so i think it really, it's kind of hard to say, okay, they are essential or it's completely non essential in life.

 34:50  
sure, yes okay. it's hard to put it on a scale like that.

 35:30  
they say no, i don't think, because it only because of our leadership change, otherwise i would have said, we've got like two or three people but they're not really active anymore.

 35:50  
no, i think that that i think it was well covered. i'm glad that there is space to talk about some of the things that we're doing that are interesting and unique to our brigade. and i think it'll be interesting to feel how those get followed up on.

 36:08  
i guess the one thing is like, for each of these projects and processes that were part of. i felt like i mean, personally, i can look at those titles and know what i'm talking about, but i'm unsure if they are clear enough for someone else to understand what. for instance, we're talking about so i'm unsure if like maybe we needed a description of those tools or processes.

 36:41  
okay, cool. yeah, that's about the only thing that i think we miss so for our starter projects. i think i said this. during the conversation, but they're a. they're projects that can be taken on by one to two people at a time, small team projects or solo projects that are designed to engage members in civic technology, before they can be on boarded to say a proper project. and they are repeatable or replicable so we've got projects that many people can do many different ways. and, like, i'm going to do it one way when i get the brief and you're going to do it a different way with different technology.

 37:40  
yeah, well, we have had like, i'd say mediocre success with it, but when it lands when someone goes through and does a starter project, they stick around for a long time, which is cool.

 37:58  
yeah so we use discord bot slack, which is something that's completely different from almost any other brigade i think just because it's free and we like it and we wrote bots for it, but the tool onboarding lets people come and join our discord and then get promoted and permission, based off of bot commands. when we go through the onboarding process. kind of like x it opens up people's access to the brigade, as we go through the onboarding process rather than, kind of, like, you come in and you have a fire hose of information on you and then, or what to do,

 38:45  
yeah, we love that tool like i said it's complicated because the people who built it. we love that tool. awesome. okay and then the project intake, it's just a form that we share with our partners before we. before we get too far into the project with them. like at the start of the project to delineate the division of responsibility for the project, and to outline and have them kind of agree to our way of working. open source and we host all the code on our repo and they're supposed to provide certain things, you know, it's really a division of responsibility and, as well as contacts and all those kinds of things. it helps the project runs smoother, but it also helps the project, he picked up again, if the project lead fails or if it like goes into hibernation. someone has all the information to pick it back up. alright, description, i'm sorry.

 40:08  
yeah, me too. i guess

 40:30  
delete my answers would be really, really intense right here.

unknown speaker  40:34  
i mean, maybe you really, you know,

unknown speaker  40:36  
it's like the lighter

unknown speaker  40:38  
organization, i don't know.

 40:40  
yeah, um, uh, i think we could do for the public. let's do it. cool.

 40:54  
i mean, whether we got

unknown speaker  40:57  
nothing to hide. yeah, what

 40:58  
do i got to lose my, my volunteer position jesus yeah,

 42:23  
i think, yeah, i think it's good i think you did a great job and i think that cofer new orleans, the ryan, i think is the is the head of that he's, i if it is the guy that i think it is. i can't remember if he's just a member or if he's a captain, but he's awesome, and. okay, if you're down there. the, they could definitely use some ux research i think on their disaster. disaster maps, they do where they, they do, they spin up brigade, armena network wide, but kind of headed out of nola for hurricane preparedness and response. okay.

 43:12  
let me, let me just go to the code for america slack real quick and see if i can find him.

unknown speaker  43:18  
okay.

 43:19  
because he's awesome he is for sure one of the best people in the network. give me one second. okay. i don't see it right off the top of my head. are you on the code for america slack.

 43:52  
yeah i think it probably is. i was just gonna say i can, i can link you to ryan whenever i find,

 44:15  
email me and if you end up getting into the code for america slack i'm just patrick collins and code for denver and some red hair on it so

 44:31  
and yeah, well, but, good to have you on the team and helping us out to do this yeah yeah boy.

wonderful it's magical, you know i have to remind myself that i'm complaining about something that i wished for for much of my life so. mm hmm.

 5:43  
yes, as they say, i got a better offer. no, i had a chance to corner a politician. so, you know. oh, fantastic.

unknown speaker  5:52  
definitely more important i'm available so i'm glad i need

 5:57  
understand.

 6:11  
right, for efficiency sake.

 6:28  
no. it's the midwest and it's yeah late autumn but yeah we know we're okay we are on stay at home again. mm hmm.

 8:48  
type that in there. correct.

 9:05  
it's fine.

 9:50  
yeah, this is what it says a variety of activities and topics, it would be it would depend on what the right activity or topic is. okay,

 10:05  
so i'm gonna say zero. i don't know.

unknown speaker  10:11  
okay.

"," 10:43  
um,

as. yeah, we adopt we've not we pretty much decided that we don't want to do that anymore, which is not rolling. yes, sir.

 11:05  
we did everything according to the book i mean the brigade itself is maybe like eight years old, quite a small town, and it was not a model that was sustainable working for us so take that in, we're gonna so, an example from a large metropolitan area. you know that didn't doesn't help.

unknown speaker  11:33  
understood. that's, that's great insight.

 11:37  
i'm sorry i have a dog who's pestering me. oh please, please

unknown speaker  11:41  
go ahead and give him some love.

 11:43  
if i can put her out. okay.

 12:08  
sorry about that. no problem. don't

unknown speaker  12:10  
worry i'm

 12:11  
still typing your answer and she will just get her nose up into the picture here in a minute.

 12:18  
but, but, so i'm sorry, go ahead.

"," 13:04  
one.

unknown speaker  13:06  
okay, great.

"," 13:19  
you would also say one on that one. good. i missed our other thing while i was pursuing scheduled meeting so that i could go and meet an official

"," 13:51  
you don't know that it's an example so much. think you can always, you can always use new ideas. mm hmm.

 14:12  
now like more more ideas are always useful. all right.

unknown speaker  14:17  
i think that's, that makes a lot of sense to this our

 14:20  
own. and now we have a cat can you hear the cat now.

 14:43  
exactly.

"," 14:54  
um, that. i think the when we posted workshops, we've done well but i'm not sure about what this user needs. you mean a workshop, just a general workshop for technologists, i met user names

 15:25  
say three on that because i'm not really sure right. okay.

"," 15:36  
yeah, we, we are tiny.

unknown speaker  15:40  
so, so you feel this one is perhaps not relevant.

 15:46  
no. okay. i think that, um, the other two brigade main brigade people are both developers in a company so i'm pretty sure that's not the part, i'm participating in that much so i think that by happens,

"," 16:24  
yeah, that's another technical question. okay.

"," 16:56  
we have not had any okay i had when we were still having regular hack nights we always read it at the beginning and

that seemed to head off anything if there was going to be a problem. so, alright.

i do think having that be part of the routine of each opening each meeting was was really wise.

 17:38  
whenever we have got had whatever kind of convenings we've been doing lately that that that was part of the intro part of the slide deck so okay review, so i

"," 18:00  
um, i don't think that you can figure that out from outside of the community.

unknown speaker  18:07  
mm hmm.

unknown speaker  18:07  
that makes sense.

 18:15  
no. so i don't know if you know i'm also on the map. the national advisory council. i didn't know

 18:27  
and so i thought about a lot of this stuff probably more than many. and so, if you are in a small to medium city. the other thing is that you have to work with whoever shows up. it's attracted to the work. mm hmm. and, um, the format for brigades that they came up with in the beginning is very project centric and developer centric. okay. and yet, there's always been this we want people who can do all these other things, to bring on this with us together, but the format is not really conducive to having non technical participants.

unknown speaker  19:15  
see, hey

 19:24  
everybody does not understand. github, and you could just do everything in github. that's easy.

"," 19:57  
well, it's mostly just me and dave so we don't. yeah.

 20:11  
oh, i guess i would give it a three. but a strategic plan in a volunteer organization. yeah, i'm going to be based upon who shows up. right.

unknown speaker  20:27  
okay.

unknown speaker  20:33  
all right,

 20:48  
that has just not happened. and, yeah.

"," 21:25  
no, we're. okay, we, you know, you need to be the best kind of brigade you can be for the size of the city you're in your community all this other makeup and and trying to follow a structure and a plan that is based somewhere else and on other assumptions is really, you know, we finally said why are we even doing, why are we even trying to do this because we've been productive and. and it isn't fun. mm hmm.

 22:16  
i mean to wreck your interview. now we're not doing

 22:30  
well if you're going to grow the brigades, you're going to run out of megalopolises pretty quickly. that's true,

unknown speaker  22:38  
that's true.

 22:39  
so the place that can grow is the places they're smaller and the small places are never going to be like this.

 22:54  
okay.

unknown speaker  22:54  
okay. ready.

unknown speaker  22:55  
next,

 22:56  
i'm gonna say 333333. okay. well,

"," 23:11  
um, we just don't spend any money. like we still have some of our seed money from the very beginning and if we want to do something. we have plenty of people we can ask who are willing to sponsor, whatever it is we want to, you know, we want to have an event or a t shirts again because it's small and there doesn't seem to be any point in asking for money for no particular purpose.

unknown speaker  23:39  
except,

 23:40  
so we're just cheap and don't spend our money. we're just thrifty.

 23:57  
um, so what would what would you need the money for the space, or the time

 25:00  
okay. thanks.

"," 25:23  
and so, such as it is being able to communicate with the people who are still around in the way that reaches them where they are. mm hmm. um, i think that the network should pay for every brigade to have its own zoom account. okay, which would not break the bank for them.

unknown speaker  25:43  
right.

 25:50  
github is useful slack as well but our the version of slack that we have will drop off your messages after a while. and now discourse is just not the same kind of collaborative tool that slack is so i mean you do different things in discourse, though. um, i, i think that it zoom is the place we're going to go and the fact that it allows you to do the recording easily would be good, although now there's more competition in the market so maybe it's

 27:08  
no, i said just something about discourse.

 27:30  
and i can't think of

 27:34  
getting up, maybe, i think it was github, that that was useful. even though i rarely do anything there, um, when we've done like national dancevic packing we use it and. okay. finding a common tool set for. if you're trying to have diverse teams that are working, particularly asynchronously is a huge challenge.

 28:31  
you have everything.

unknown speaker  28:35  
so you have all these tools. these tools.

 28:53  
well and the tools that are used for when we build stuff is kind of his dates. mm hmm. yeah.

unknown speaker  29:03  
okay.

unknown speaker  29:06  
um.

"," 29:19  
one. okay.

"," 29:29  
that i'm not going to before i even got here.

unknown speaker  29:33  
okay, so you're not sure,

 29:35  
yeah like but i i don't think that onboarding should be done by staff alone. network stuff. no, i think that that's part of why we're having issues with brigades coming on board and then just fading away because i don't think that they're getting. they're getting a theoretic explanation of how brigades work, etc. and since that model doesn't really, it doesn't scale down. right.

 30:18  
i think that because onboarding of new brigades oh do you mean onboarding to our. mmm. good question.

 30:34  
not sure if it's viable enough i thought you were saying like, when you were on boarded as a brigade, that's what i thought your question,

 30:43  
certainly be either of those other two things right onboarding new people in our brigade to know about the national network. right. that's a good question onboarding thing to your onboarding people to your brigade but they're not with the national so it's one of those two things

 31:04  
and i don't think that i think because the model doesn't scale down and that hasn't really been grappled with and i'm really hoping that this process, right here, surface that. mm hmm. that it sets people up for failure. yeah.

 31:35  
right then, the network team that are cfa staff. okay, they have, they do the recruiting and they do the onboarding.

 31:59  
idea and i have no idea what they're telling people. oh, as a representative gates, i found. how are things going in there like i, there's, i can tell there's a disconnect.

unknown speaker  32:13  
okay, and

"," 32:38  
out of my wheelhouse. okay.

unknown speaker  32:47  
"," 32:58  
before i think that we do this well.

 33:09  
well it is then. yes, i been able to visit brigades i could never visit. hmm, person and, um, yeah. so i'm sorry i complained about soon. i take it all back.

 33:35  
yes. yeah. okay,

"," 33:50  
we don't, we don't know. okay, it's, it's our brigade, we've as a very racially divided city. hmm. geographically and historically, and finding common ground. we have worked with the human relations council on a couple of projects. but in terms of having people come from. and also we have had some community organizations use our software that we made around. finding tax foreclosed properties that that they could buy and they were using the tool. but as far as having people come to be a part of the brigade group. just. and we meet downtown we we don't meet in a suburb we meet centrally in a part of town that wouldn't be you know that some people might consider rough. it's the mean streets of dayton, believe me it's not very new. and, yeah, i don't know. okay,

"," 35:32  
that isn't even something that we aspire to. okay. and that's just simply because of who happens to be our volunteer group up to, mostly.

unknown speaker  35:53  
all right.

"," 36:23  
no, those are not things that we are interested in doing. there are lots of other places that you could do that. and, as it became evident that this macknight model was becoming on satisfactory for those of us whose who kept showing up trying to get news project started was just futile most of the time because ownership. they come in with an idea but they wanted someone to do it for them. i feel like so what what is it that we can do that people want to volunteer, can't do somewhere else. you know, you don't need to be teaching people coding resume, all those things that you listed are things they do somewhere else and what, what is the code for america brigade offer a volunteer that they can't get anywhere else.

unknown speaker  37:20  
sounds great question.

 37:23  
see it really is struggling to figure out how to answer that. i think particularly in it. well, and also in a big city where you you're competing with people for their volunteer time. and you know these are high value volunteers. and so, um, you have to you have to have something that attracts them. mm hmm, the kind of work that we are extensively trying to do it. as sid harold's new book says this work is not for tourists. mm hmm. um, it takes longer term commitment etc so, this workforce development, that kind of stuff we're just like, nope.

 38:32  
well and and code for america proper not the brigades as workforce, but you know like they have a job board, you know they have staff. and, and they are connected to be able to make those kind of links level. um, i just don't really think it's appropriate, unless we would post, you know, find out about a job and pass that on so that they can see if a job board. so, it could be part of the pipeline but only ancillary activity. makes sense.

 39:17  
to say my next meeting is at six.

"," 39:48  
and something that could be answered. for me, in a document. hmm. right, um, because the brigade organizers playbook is basically a document.

 40:27  
that. so the, the, even the term playbook assumes that you have some answers, even array of answers. right. i mean i've never played a sport where you've had. i've seen the pictures of the diagrams of where you run the football right. oh, um, and so there's more than one way to do that and a playbook shows you what those options are wrong. and so having it be able to offer options for really small brigades and working with the kinds of expertise you come up with linking people across brigades, and to the central network better which wasn't even an aspiration years ago so we've already made some improvement in that.

so the playbook is to be a resource and has general generally it's been something that's static. what i would like to see in it is if you have gone to this document app website, whatever it is. and you get to the point where you're not getting the answer. you don't go to one that there's that takes you to a person. okay.

 42:00  
right so that sort of you get to that depth and you go no, none of these things helped me, right, that there's something beyond a chat bot. and then it would, and to have something that's maybe more engaging and open ended at the front door of it. in a concierge kind of way.

 42:47  
so, yes, and i know that all of this is constantly evolving and the fact that there was a playbook. in the beginning, as a resource but you had to go and find it in the google docs and it was there but it was not evident, and we're getting better. yes, gonna make it way better moving forward

 43:22  
i did not think we would still have sexism. by now, let me tell you. as i said, my bra a long time ago we should not still be doing this stuff. mm hmm.

"," 44:29  
not off the top of my head. no. okay.

 44:52  
so i am a co captain.

 44:56  
captain, so

 45:01  
pro captain. the pro co captain. alright, co captain.

unknown speaker  45:07  
um,

 45:09  
we don't really have any other things, except two co captains, okay. and our money.

 45:37  
so why active since we aren't having hack nights, and we don't call people together unless there's something specific, anymore. okay. and so, people do follow the meetup. and if it's something they're interested in, i would say that we have maybe eight to 10, people that are kind of in this silent pool off somewhere. that will rise up and participate and then go back, when the thing is over. okay. it's always the same, it's not always the same people. um, depends on what the thing is that we're doing.

 46:34  
how many i still think it would probably be in that's from from our side, it would be probably in that 10 people range. sure, we had was a little over a year ago now, an instance where the ku klux klan was coming to town. mm hmm. and it just to the main town square. and, you know, the whole city was kind of going crazy and mayor's office was concerned about coordinate because everybody wanted to do something and they needed a way to kind of coordinate coordinate what was going to happen, you know, in real time because. and so we had the mayor's office, and the people from the human relations council, come to. i had like we had a special meeting and said we're going to try to help them with this issue. so, a lot of people came to that. yeah, they're interested in that thing and we ended it ended up that they really just needed people to coach them through using some of the tools that they already had.

unknown speaker  47:48  
mm hmm. okay.

 47:51  
but everyone kind of came together for this. that's great. yeah, people that we hadn't seen for a really long time.

unknown speaker  47:58  
so that's all. huh.

 48:11  
yeah. okay, wrote national tabs to the packing too we had an all ohio team organized and, and they work for 10 hours. um,

 48:50  
so dave was one of the founders so you'd have to look and see what year that started. and i think i must have come about 2013. to get any note. no one. as i said, we've been through a long time of trying to get people to a lot of people suggest projects they don't want to. it's a lot of work.

unknown speaker  49:25  
i understand,

 49:26  
i'm not sure that we will. we've had a couple of recent conversations. well, last year and then again a few weeks ago about whether whether this brigade is a brigade anymore and whether this is something that we want to do or. no. but we have a great reputation.

unknown speaker  49:50  
i think that's important. yeah, it is.

 49:53  
you made some things that were super useful and conspicuous. and so people were like, oh yeah they did that and people are like, oh yeah you guys do great work we're like we haven't done anything. ah, but. okay,

 50:23  
yes. there's.

 50:41  
but you think there was likely to be anything in there that was going to

unknown speaker  50:46  
be relevant for your for your group. okay, i understand.

unknown speaker  50:49  
um

 50:58  
okay. but that's just because we have a lot of history.

 51:12  
was like none, none of this really fits our situation so make sense.

 51:58  
pal no, it may have been helpful. at some point, i'm sure it was helpful in the beginning so one, i wouldn't give it a zero but okay number the a little bit helpful.

unknown speaker  52:09  
mm hmm. all right,

 52:12  
i guess it's a starting point.

 52:42  
i'm recommend, that's a good word isn't it. mm hmm.

 52:50  
so i would definitely let people know such a thing exists and that there's a lot of wisdom in there about what's happened in other places, but that it may not, you know, sort of let take what take what you want and leave the rest behind because it isn't a template that may fit you. right. that makes sense.

unknown speaker  53:16  
um, what number what i should put that down insert 10.

unknown speaker  53:22  
um,

 53:27  
corresponding to each no this happens to me. none of those answers, and how likely am i to recommend it. yeah, i don't know what to definitely say you should know about it. so, um, so i would. it's that word recommend again right so whatever is in the middle of the scale let's just go with

unknown speaker  53:51  
five. okay, it's zero.

unknown speaker  53:55  
so, there

 53:56  
was he doesn't tell to either way.

 54:10  
i think that new brigades do take this and think that this is how to make things work. okay. okay. and so then if they do those things and they don't work they feel like they failed.

unknown speaker  54:23  
oh,

 54:25  
no, actually, that playbook is great for big cities. right. and it's

 54:39  
by a disclaimer on the playbook.

 54:53  
you guys, i really appreciate. i don't know how they managed to do this that they're getting the people to devote the time to doing these interviews because.

 55:41  
no, i think, i think dave has the opportunity to be interviewed as well. mm hmm. so there really isn't.

 56:05  
don't know i have passed along the co kaufman's name. okay.

 56:26  
i'm sorry. people don't normally call me so i know in return. people don't call me either. that's why that unless they're solicitors mm over that's better.

unknown speaker  56:38  
all right.

 56:52  
yeah, i don't know that it would is necessarily a question that is appropriate for here but it would be. i want to know why people are volunteering as why they want to be a brigade as opposed to doing all the other things they could be doing as a volunteer, what what is it about code for america that attracted you to want to be a part of it. i don't know that that has to do with the playbook but that's what came into my mind.

 57:30  
of code for america. i mean that's the idea. you know, that's sort of the beacon. okay, max people to brigades, whatever that idea is, and that you know that being in the brigade is, is a means of connecting to that larger thing but what what is that that people are looking for when they, they come to this particular organization.

 58:13  
exactly actually do that as opposed to resume building. learning to basic coding, those sorts of things that that really there's plenty of other places that you could do that.

 59:13  
you just use past tense about yourself.

unknown speaker  59:18  
oh about myself about,

 59:19  
i was a phd, i was like, why did they take it away.

unknown speaker  59:25  
have it but i'm,

unknown speaker  59:26  
i guess distancing

 59:31  
die. so,

 59:46  
interesting. so my day job is, i have been an emergency nurse, off and on for years and years so i actually still went back to take care of patients a few years ago just to work hard. so, but i i don't lead with that ever because once somebody puts you in that box and they're like once they know you're a nurse that that that is so laden exactly associations that they won't be able to think of you as doing anything else and really just my day, my, my cash cow that's my easy money.

 1:00:45  
about that some other day. and maybe we can do some policy work. wow. around the date healthcare data policy because part of the reason the system is so screwed up is data that they make policy decisions on. yeah. okay.

 1:01:18  
i didn't curse at all which i think was excellent. oh, i wouldn't have minded.

yeah, but i mean, yourself,

 1:01:39  
yeah.

and then this disclose to cfa staff and nak. would that be just the brigade and not the interview age you know what i mean like that should have been a branch logic there. they're gonna know what it is. anyway, you might as well. i said, i'm pretty transparent.

 1:02:32  
yeah, no, i don't know what fully public means either.

 1:02:39  
yeah no i i guess fully public because. yeah. okay. i don't think i haven't told you anything i haven't.

 1:02:53  
you know, it

 1:03:11  
and i would be interested in talking, you know brainstorming with you about some of how to make healthcare better through.

 1:03:29  
i really like this there's always a vulnerability somewhere in those systems.

 1:03:47  
okay,

 1:04:15  
i got i got one more another hour and a half. okay. well, it's all right. nice to meet you, helen

unknown speaker  1:04:23  
way. nice to meet you, janet. enjoy the rest of your day.

the one that made me pause when you said proposed

was is really that i

we could use

to learn from other brigades about more of a hybrid model,

where when we resume in person,

events,

how best to

offer virtual

opportunities at the same time.

just at a practical level, having a bunch of people in an echo room how to make that a decent experience for those attending virtually

one other would be

i guess, developing interest in the organization among the broader professional community, developers, designers,

product people, etc.

unknown speaker  13:03  
so i'm about to go yes or no question. so almost all the people you've asked before you answered gus, and started telling us more about it, please just answer yes or no. and then in a few seconds, we'll have a space for you to talk about this in a structured way. so as for note following question. so "," 14:24  
i am an incoming co captain.

unknown speaker  14:31  
roughly how many active members are a new brigade active 12.

unknown speaker  14:45  
roughly how long has the current brigade leadership and managing the

 14:54  
two years

unknown speaker  14:57  
have you seen the have you seen the bomb? yes.

unknown speaker  15:29  
all right. so on a scale of one to five, how helpful have you found bob to be worth one being not helpful oil and five being extremely helpful?

 15:46  
i don't feel like i can answer this fairly because i've not spent much time with it. i just saw it the other day. forget congress.

so if it's easier, if it's easier to say no to the previous question, you can do that, too.

unknown speaker  16:16  
you've seen it, but i guess

unknown speaker  16:21  
a hard one because there is no option to say.

 16:27  
hey, i mean, yeah, i've seen that. but i've not.

i've not really gone through it. so

maybe that's more

what that question man. have you seen it? like?

am i familiar with the content? have i tried to utilize it? replicate? the answer's no. just familiar with it, and i opened it up from the other day.

unknown speaker  17:02  
we put up like, three and a first i just like to try just put a footnote in like the one before just like, say use like paper. okay.

unknown speaker  17:42  
okay, so you've asked many questions today. and we appreciate all of your responses. so as i wrap up this conversation, i have a few more final questions. would you be interested in self service versions of survey for your members, this would show that show what members prioritized and any, any effective processes or practices they want to share?

 18:08  
yeah, yes.

unknown speaker  18:11  
so would there be anyone else in your prograde? who would like to participate and helping us document your brigades effective processes and practices? if yes, you want to provide their info? info now?

 18:29  
i don't know.

unknown speaker  18:38  
alright, is there anything else we should know? or should have asked?

unknown speaker  18:54  
i'm just going to transfer the for the previous two questions. i'll just transfer those here if that's fine.

 19:05  
transfer them

unknown speaker  19:07

all right, so thank you for taking time today. wednesday, we will send you a follow up email with helpful links, including how to pass this interview opportunity on to other leaders and the current version of the vault. you'll also be receiving a copy of responses to again, thank you for thank you and have a

i would say, specifically, connecting volunteers with projects. so, conducting specific skills. okay.

 15:40  
um, not in particular, just maybe the word recruiting is appropriate here. okay.

 16:02  
oh, i don't think so. okay.

"," 16:36  
no, not yet.

 16:44  
um, we have a lot of exciting things coming up. but you're not there yet.

 17:11  
and the brigade captain. okay.

 17:32  
so i mean i would, i would depends on how you calculate it. we don't have a clear metric for that. i would say probably roughly 100 people. and but i want to give you something a little more specific. if it's popping up here. we have weekly we have 119 numbers active on slack.

unknown speaker  18:12  
okay.

 18:21  
roughly three months.

 18:33  
is this a recent one or is this an older one by code for america.

 18:59  
i can probably answer in the spirit of the question which is that there's not something that we are currently referring to.

 19:17  
it's late in the day and i appreciate you making the time. um, i would say, yes, i have seen it. no, we do not actively refer to it. so i'm looking at it right now, so. so it depends what the question is one about just awareness that it exists. yes, if it yeah you know something. yeah.

 19:58  
oh, probably when it was first published. okay. so it looks like. probably it says updated in june of 2018 so at least then a bit before. okay,

 20:38  
to. to.

 20:56  
probably zero or one whichever the lowest one is.

unknown speaker  21:00  
yeah, the

 21:09  
um, it's very high level. it provides some thoughts about different things and where to start things. so if you're very lost, and you're not sure what you need to do, then it's helpful. but if i'm going to refer someone to a resource what i'll be referring them to is something more specific. that's a, here's an example of how you do this, and the, you know, the specific approach that you might find successful. now, think outside that box. but it would just be a more specific resource. yeah.

 22:22  
i'm not specifically but i really do want to take the same idea and transform it a little bit for, for members. okay.

unknown speaker  22:36  
so,

 22:42  
well, so, um, the i think the format of this, this sort of surveys, i think, very good. and yes, some good practices. so, but i think the the questions for members would be. more specifically, understanding what it takes to run a project, as opposed to what it takes to run a brigade.

 23:23  
i did ask, not so far. okay.

unknown speaker  23:29  
and

 23:57  
i'm just, i'm. so, in regards to having, like really strong specifics. how do you know how in depth is, i'm trying to think of the question. i'm trying to. so what's the direction that you guys are going with in terms of creating a voip do you know.

 27:00  
gotcha. yeah, that makes sense. um, yeah all my all my questions because these things get me excited, are all more in depth and i want to jump into well how do you do this how do you do that. so, if we're not there yet that i think i'm pretty good. i'll be patient. so,

 27:42  
alright, let me, let me think here. a yes, yes, more specific than remotes meetings, because we saw i think i said a five maybe on remote participation in running a remote hacknight. or maybe i didn't, i don't know, i'm running out. logistically is not important. we have the logistics down. right. at this point, unfortunately, um, we found something that works to connect people and, you know, we're gonna develop it but more important than that is building a remote community. so, not about, you know, meeting times logistics software to use, not even about project to project development, but about how we help people meet each other how we help people to, to know each other to bond and become part of the code for san francisco family. that's the big challenge we have, because we've all been to online happy hours, and they kind of suck at least compared to in person happy hours. right. and given that we have another. i want to be really optimistic and say, given that we have at least another six months of covid. i know, right. but let's, even if it was only six months, how do we keep people engaged. during that time. that's the challenge that's that's number one like it hasn't hit our metrics right now i don't know how the heck, we have the same people on slack as we did before. doesn't make sense. but it can't last forever. so, yeah, especially with holidays. it's gonna be really difficult holidays.

 29:59  
yeah. with the brigade for a long time.

 31:05  
so, yeah.

 31:28  
yeah, absolutely. it's a great place to get started, especially working with bonnie and her millions of connections. so it's got to be yeah it's got to be exciting. we're time to start, but hey, congratulations on graduating, that's pretty fantastic.

 31:50  
so, so weird.

 32:15  
oh, that's cool. yeah,

 32:28  
on your on your graduation presentation or the presentation for god. yeah.

 32:56  
your m.

 33:12  
so it's the second start with an m because that would be great for them. oh,

 33:25  
yeah, together and come up with something very different, so i'm sorry i got your name wrong.

 33:49  
yeah, and that's everyone's graduation you just hope they get it right and you can start to prepare for the worst. so, i'm sure, i'm sure it'll be fine. it'll be a unique experience. i mean who gets to do a virtual graduation like that.

 34:16  
weren't we all. but here's the bright side, if you don't like hack for la, you can always join code for san francisco you'd have to go anywhere. we're all online

 35:07  
yeah, well, what's what's great for the research you're doing is that you can go to any brigade anytime and see actually what they're doing. it's fantastic. i was able to drop it on boston and. and i'm curious to see how shy hack nights are nowadays. yeah, see, see and learn for the best i haven't dropped in on you guys yet. i think i've gone to a happy hour too, but it's been a little while.

 35:53  
for sure. well, i'll let you go i won't chat you're the last time oh well.

 36:25  
okay. oh, i'm fully public that's fine. yeah.

three,

three, it's a bit strange for us with fundraising.

 7:05  
well,

because we're such a small town, there just aren't that many places to go. i got some, some money from the university, where i work when i when i accepted. when i accepted my job, i negotiated funding for a new code for america brigade, zoom 2. that's what we've been using. so we have we have that but you know, in the future, and especially if i'm not the brigade captain anymore, there probably needs to be so sources of funding outside the university.

"," 8:02  
i think we're doing pretty good with that stuff. so to

"," 8:14  
five,

"," 8:22  
meaning

like getting people involved with the code for america slack and attending the conferences.

five

unknown speaker  8:47  
-----------

"," 8:57  
three.

"," 9:11  
five

"," 9:23  
three, but we're such a small town so i don't know if that's going to be a very different thing for us. okay.

"," 9:53  
i'll see too because i'm not sure we're ever going to have the capacity given the size have the brigade in the town? if we do, you almost certainly have to be

through the university that's here.

"," 10:25  
yes, finding and developing projects.

so, i guess just to elaborate on that, the big challenge for us right now, and maybe this is due to covid, it's, um, i keep having conversations with potential community partners. and it always, it always, sort of turns out the same way where it's, um, you know, if we had time and energy, we could totally do something, but we don't have time, we don't have energies. so we can't really do something. but let's,

let's revisit this, like, in a year.

i've been getting a lot of that.

 11:27  
um,

in addition, i guess volunteer,

the entire like, volunteer, whatever you would call it like lifespan from onboarding through. organization, once they're onboarding to a project to how to navigate when people spin off a project. i mean, leave a project, whether they tell you they do or they don't tell you they do.

 12:10  
let's continue.

"," 13:07  
there are things that we've done that have worked well. so

 13:17  
but we're just we're just one year in right so

 13:44  
okay.

okay, so you want me to type these in the chat?

 13:59  
okay.

should i should i just like type everything or

 15:40  
i guess that's it. and it all comes with the caveat that we don't fully know what we're doing yet. okay.

 16:03  
i think it's it's reaching out to college students and to working professionals. okay, we're a college town. mm hmm. so that that one's really important.

 16:21  
no documentation done.

 16:31  
um, i have a list of contacts. and i reach out to everybody on that list. and it gets to me. it gets me pretty far into the university network and the town network.

 17:18  
well, we start with

the whole process,

that kind of fluid. okay, so we, it starts with me talking to the community partner enough to decide that a project is viable, and what that project is going to be. and then i reach out to just a couple volunteers, people who i know from previous projects, who i know would still be interested to build a core team. so first, first, i recruit the community partner, then i recruit the project manager,

and a tech lead. mm hmm.

then i'm with the community partner and the project manager in the tech lead, we

choose a day for a launch event

in order to tell people about the project. and then at that point, we start to recruit volunteers, so i post to meet up and then i post to the, the city of charlottesville. just like residents of charlottesville maintain a slack page. and it's mostly

mostly populated by people

who work tech jobs.

so

is that that's a great way for us to reach out to people. um, i, i use a program to get free advertising in some of the newspapers in town. okay, um, i and then at the university i used my standing as an employee at that university to, um, reach out to professor in the computer science department and the stats department and the school of data science to this to send out on like, listservs about the event.

um, those are the big ones.

for the last project, i was able to get a story in the university daily newsletter, which was pretty great for the for like all 40,000 people or so get that, huh.

so,

 20:05  
um,

we currently document nothing, unless it's on github as part of the deliverables for the project. um, so we, we document code. but i haven't been documenting any other brigade operations, mostly because it's me. and it's like, so much time and bandwidth just to do it.

 20:55  
um, always working with community partner.

 21:07  
no, i'm just, it's more a philosophical principle.

i'm

just because i'm,

i'm aware of

the ethical problems that have occurred. when tech people involve themselves in community. yes. and the tech team might have very good intentions, but they don't have the the subject matter knowledge to be really helpful. and a lot of times, when when when tech people kind of pick up the ball and run with it, um, it? how should i put it sharp, sharp, charlottesville is a great town. but it's an old town with a long history and people who've lived through their entire lives, and i've seen the town change. and there are divisions. and there are tensions between the city and the university. yeah.

and i'm

one of the ways those tensions have

popped up, is researchers from the university go into, like poor neighborhoods in the city, and they make demands, like with the guise of good intentions, like, say, you know, we're studying poverty or something, and,

you know, and it comes off

as invasive, it comes off as rude. and it comes off as like, asking a lot and delivering very little. and i'm not saying that this happens all that much anymore, but it has happened, going back decades and decades, right? because this is a university, it's been around since the early 1800s. so, um, there's a long memory.

and

it's still a problem, because there are people who live in this town who find themselves in like a sociologically interesting group of people. mm hmm. and so then researchers from the university, knock on their door, like every other day, with some other requests to be in some other study. yeah. and so with that context, it's, it's, it's just a sensitivity that's required. we have to, um, it would be very easy to piss people off, if we decide, oh, we're just going to go solve this problem and like steamroll over people. what we have to do is put ourselves in a position to listen and to work on behalf or not, not not to work in place of but to work with, and for existing community networks, and not to try to

steamroll over those networks.

 24:12  
so yeah, we always have to work with the community, we can never work by ourselves.

 24:35  
yeah, well,

there are many towns like charlottesville, right, yet have big divisions in terms of university and city in terms of educated and people who haven't been given those education opportunities between bridging poor, between racial groups between age groups, between language groups. and so, um,

i think that every brigade is

going to have to contend with this challenge of how do you

help people?

um, who might not? who have been hurt by these sorts of things in the past? mm hmm.

um, and

how do you first of all, how do you check yourself to make sure that your intentions and your,

um,

your point of view is is good? right? um, and then and then set? and then if, if you're doing it for the right reasons, then how do you go about it in order to maximize good and minimize harm? mm hmm. um, and part of that is, how do you have these initial conversations? right? how do you build trust? how do you get on the same page? how do you work together? um, i don't know that a guide will be able to, yeah, um, do that. but i think within a guide, the point should be made. i think this is something that should absolutely be in the blp. the point should be made that good intentions are not

enough. okay.

um,

because good intentions can lead to great harm. if, if a brigade is not willing to put in the work, to wait, and listen, and build a relationship with existing community networks.

 27:00  
yeah, i almost kind of want to delete that.

 27:04  
we started with that, and it didn't. so like the logic was, um, because like the university and and downtown, they're like a mile apart. and it's a pain in the butt to park on campus. but college students at uva they get so like, focused on their campus. yeah. like, you can't even get them to hop on a bus. come downtown, right. so like, we felt like it, it would be smart to alternate, and maybe it is, but now with zoom, i think we could just be in one spot. and we can just have all of our events, hybrid. so that people who don't want to deal with parking or whatever, they can just show up on zoom. and we just got to find a way to involve everybody. it's not an issue for us now, because everything's on.

 28:22  
you with code for la?

 29:12  
very much depends on how you define active. hmm, yeah, it's somewhere between 20 and 40. but fewer than 20 come to any one of our heck nights. we do have people who come to hack nights now and then and do things on our projects now. and then we've had maybe

30 different people contribute code

to our latest project.

maybe 50 people contribute code to any of our projects over the past year. um, but um, there are some people who are kind of like taking high hiatus and might be back. and there's there's some people who i might never see again. like, it's very hard to keep track. yeah.

 30:38  
sorry, one second.

my wife?

sorry, what was your question?

 30:55  
no, no, i'm very interested in it too. and i want to talk to you a bit more about about that. yeah. um, my, my day job is i'm a professor of data science. mm hmm.

um,

i'm trying to do research into this

new movement that code for america is very centrally involved in, which is like, tech for social good. yeah. and i'm, i'm trying to write articles and a book about characterizing what this movement is, and examples of how it can be done really well. and examples of how it can be done less well. and i'm looking at it from like, a much bigger picture. but when i heard about the dlp, i thought, oh, my god, this is an amazing project. it's really related to things i want to research. and so i wanted to ask you and the other people who are involved with this particular initiative, how i could be involved with it. um, yeah. so so i don't mean to derail the interview, but i want to i want to be involved with this particular project. for the blp. yeah, if possible. and, yeah,

 33:30  
yes, i'd be interested. i don't know.

i don't know who would be.

who would feel comfortable taking that because we

i think people feel attached to a project.

 33:48  
and not.

not yet to the brigade, because brigade really

hasn't existed very much beyond

the project's right. yeah. sonia.

um,

but you know, i can, i can see.

i could see if anybody would be comfortable taking that, so.

 34:30  
it's related to one of my goals this year, is to

i don't have a core team.

oh, it's just me. it's just yeah, um,

i, i have people who are serving as leads for projects.

mm hmm. um, but one

of my goals this year is to recruit a core team.

 34:50  
if if i can recruit a core team, my hope

is that somebody on that core team would be interested in doing exactly, this.

yeah. this kind of stuff. documentation.

 35:15  
it's about 5050. it's really great.

um,

so it's about 50% and

va, both graduate and undergraduate, and about 50% people who work for some company, either remotely, or for one of the companies in charlottesville. okay, that's a pretty robust tech scene for a small town.

so, um, yeah.

 35:49  
um,

i guess.

i guess where i'm where i'm personally struggling is,

like i just mentioned, the fact that i don't currently

have

a core team. and, and so i worry very much about my ability to continue to do everything that needs to be done to maintain the brigade. um, it's possible i could get sick. there's a pandemic, you know, yeah, it's possible. um, i could get distracted.

um,

and, and it might, it's passed by my burnout. yeah, um, i

i'm trying to,

to get the brigade known to get the brigade established, so that there's always something for people to be working on. and so that there's always a pipeline where people can be in a leadership role for a while and then step back and let somebody else do it. mm hmm. yeah, i feel pretty stuck. i'm finding a core team. um, i feel guilty, asking some of our

some of our volunteers to do this, because

people are working really hard on the housing hub project that we're currently doing. um, i, i am going to have like, individual conversations with those people and see, mm hmm. but i don't want to overwhelm people so that they like stop doing stuff. yeah. for the project. you know what i mean?

yeah. um,

i, i had a conversation with bonnie several months ago. and she she suggested even doing like a linkedin, linkedin, and indeed post to like, recruit leadership to a brigade. i'm still thinking about that.

 37:54  
no like who we would. we would like pretreat that way. but

 39:05  
you can make them fully public. okay.

 39:13  
i think i think there's one more thing come to think of it that that maybe i would recommend adding. so when i'm thinking about like my own interest in like this topic,

it's, um,

there are so many examples of tech projects that start off with really good intentions that need to be stopped or, or because they're not working in the way people intended. or they, they. so like, think about all those hackathons that are like to do something good in the world. i have people show up in these t shirts, and there's a smoke machine and there's a dj and like, all this stuff happens and then at the end of it, it's like what what the hell like we we like to code and we'd like dump it on the lap of a homeless shelter or something. yeah. and then like, what, what was the point of all that? i think i think that a tech project that is, is well intentioned, but doesn't take into account the practical matters of actually generating a useful outcome. i think that does harm. because we, we work with people who are doing the real work, who work at a homeless shelter who work for a nonprofit who work for local government who are doing, we're doing very hard work, very essential work. they're overworked, they're underpaid. and we're asking them to give up their free time to help us with a tech project that we say is going to help them if we don't help them. i think that's a tragedy. so i think what i would want to know from these sorts of interviews, and i don't know how to ask people politely about it. but like, for the projects you've taken on what was the outcome? man, like, honestly say, like, what was the outcome? did? did it? did it result in something that was actually useful? successful?

how did the community partners feel about it?

um,

because because for this

playbook, i, i want to, like take this data that you're collecting, and then look at what what are the strategies? what are the best practices that lead to a successful outcome? for the community partner? not just for the volunteers for the brigade? okay.

so okay, off my soapbox, okay.

 42:27  
is it?

 43:30  
thank you. i really appreciate you taking the time. and i want to reiterate, i would love to be involved with this project. yeah,

",,," 5:15  
but i still think there should be an example in the playbook

",,,," 6:01  
that was the three. yeah, it's my voice crack.

"," 6:16  
not the satan guide.

"," 6:32  
during non covid times, when there are local government job opportunities, actually, there might be and i really should.

anyways, for

"," 6:59  
three, i have something to say about this. and what is it?

unknown speaker  7:06  
if you want to say so

 7:07  
if we're recording, right? yeah. did we, okay, the never got the consent bar at the top that says this meeting is now being recorded, or at least it's not there now. just wanted to say that to make sure that it is recorded. oh,

unknown speaker  7:26  
it's on my phone. uh huh.

unknown speaker  7:29  
okay, yeah. so

 7:33  
part of the reason that brigades exists is to help people develop skills to help people build a portfolio with skills that they have learned and can practice their javascript, for instance, in real time projects that benefit the community. and that's great. and in no other sector 100 i, i don't know if this is 100% true, but like, look around the world. and find another example of a space in which act that kind of explicit skill development is done on an entirely volunteer basis. right, that is something that people pay for. and that's something that our industry, as the tech sector has the resources and capacity to pay for more explicitly. and so sure, there are grant funding opportunities and public funding for people to learn how to code. in some cases, especially underrepresented folks. that's great. but if brigade leaders are expected to shepherd people through that process, then there should be some monetary support for that work. okay. we've had projects derailed by people coming in and being like, oh, well, i know a little bit of coding and, and i'm trying to learn more, and we're like, alright, here's the project, jump in. now, like, oh, i, i can't do this, right. and it's like, we're not here to hold your hand and teach you things. but we are here to teach you things and help you develop skill. i mean, i should, i'm really not a programmer. right. so it's very hard for me to figure out how to navigate that. but anyways, that's this is another area in which volunteerism just doesn't cut it if we want to channel people into good tech. and part of what we hope is that people will move be channeled into good tech by our work.

then we need to back that up. yeah.

unknown speaker  9:50  
with real resources, not just t shirts. yeah. sorry.

"," 10:19  
partnerships and recruitment from local private sector tech companies.

partnerships, explicitly focused on skill development, such as those with university computer science students, eg local boot camps, and those sort of recruiting pipelines, examples of how to establish that what that looks like. and

yeah, yeah, i think that that's it.

"," 11:44  
so i mean, we like,

we have so few documented practices and processes. i mean, i guess that like, our use of trello. and github projects was interesting, but it's certainly not unique. right? it's not like it's not like a revolutionary idea. two other brigades document and plan out your work on trello and have weekly sprint meetings in which you discuss what got done and what needs to happen. right. like, that's how most brigades work. and the fact that we're still just trying to figure that out and get it to work is something that i explicitly would not like to share and wish on. yeah. you know what i mean? so like, like having a sprint and a project board, not revolutionary, we don't have unique practices and processes that i think would provide benefit to other aids. okay. that's

 13:21  
i am the co captain of the brigade. okay, and my role is like, and maybe this is part of why the brigade sometimes causes me so much stress, because my role is both is undefined in the broadest possible way. like, i am a pinch hitter to come in and try to get a project advanced. i help with project management, and try to coordinate an established partnerships. i am a point of contact in the community. and i am also in the sense just like a brigade member who is committed to this idea of using tech for public good outcomes. but so as the co captain, like we don't have a traditional we don't have like, much of a support system for projects. you know, so the co captain kind of becomes the project lead sometimes, or the idea generator. i really wish that we had people coming on board. and i could say i as the co captain, on board people and then hand wave their projects and say, off with you. this is a great idea. get to work, right? that's not the case. i'm struggling to be like okay, bow yeah, how about we do a food insecurity thing? what about a voter turnout dashboard as part of our election information app? here's the spreadsheet with the voter turnout information. and here's how i got it. someone put it on to the website, because i will take like, an hour and a half to do that, when really, i would just like someone else to do it. and then i'll try to write some data visualizations for it. but i, i'm, you know, like, anyway,

set a clear enough answer.

 15:47  
less than 10.

maybe as few as yet, but yeah, less than 10 is good. okay.

 16:06  
roughly too long.

it's been two years, actually about exactly. since the former leader, stepped back, got a private sector job left the city and elected the two of two of us into leadership. i have been doing this for about two years. the other co captain jordan has been doing this for one year. okay. so actually, i mean, it's not it's about the exact right amount of time to now like, transition out. there's just no one to transition to. that sucks.

 17:09  
i, but i have been no, i have not well. i may have seen it. is it a big google

unknown speaker  17:15  
doc? yeah. it's a big, it's like google doc. yeah,

 17:19  
i've seen it. i definitely saw it during my onboarding. back in january 2019, or whatever that was.

with thing goes with veronica.

unknown speaker  17:34  
okay, um,

 17:35  
they definitely shared it. and

yeah, so i think i've seen it, but i haven't engaged with him much. okay.

 17:59  
i'm gonna grab

a coffee out of my fridge while you think

unknown speaker  18:03  
that's okay.

 19:00  
where is the bob?

unknown speaker  19:01  
by the way? it's, i could actually send a

unknown speaker  19:07  
yeard

 19:09  
resources for brigade leaders. organizers playbook. yeah, there we go. the the, the bomb hasn't been particularly useful to me. but that may not be the fault of the bop. if if that tracks i mean, you probably know what i'm what i'm getting out when i say that is like i have seen it but not used enough. and so it hasn't been useful to me. that doesn't mean it's not useful period. brigades with a diverse team of leaders are more sustainable and more active groups with just one leader, you don't say? how do we get this unicorn leader into the fold? i mean, i like i really could use help finding new leadership people. and i have expressed that to your colleagues previously. okay.

unknown speaker  20:33  
so

unknown speaker  20:35  
on the scale of 125, i kind of need to

 20:39  
write to, you said least useful as one.

 20:55  
zero to 10.

seven.

you won't net a promoter score out of me mari.

unknown speaker  21:06  
that added it. i'm

 21:09  
sixes and sevens are worthless.

unknown speaker  21:11  
i know.

 21:15  
no, i actually, i would recommend the playbook. so let's go ahead and make that and make it an a. well, we'll just had the metrics.

oops, i said that on the recording.

 22:04  
no problem. i had this blocked until three. so i'm not pressed for time. yeah.

 22:19  
when you say the survey,

 22:26  
oh, this interview?

unknown speaker  22:28  
yeah.

unknown speaker  22:29  
but the questions that you the questions? yeah,

unknown speaker  22:33  
question? yes,

unknown speaker  22:34  
absolutely.

 23:05  
so trey, try both hard be ot rd is his name.

and his email

is tre dot, but hard@gmail.com.

and i'm gonna tell trey and jordan that they will be hearing from you said, okay, did jordan reach out to jordan robinson? who's the other co captain of our brigade?

 24:23  
yes, it's the email from dad.

 24:54  
well, jordan has been focused on other priorities lately, and so may not have seen that email anyways. and so i'm gonna go ahead and say

that

which jordan is the jordan? sorry, jordan has two accounts. i think i emailed the correct one. so let me give you jordan robinson as well, that spelled pretty much how you'd expect.

and the email to us.

jordan net code for greensborough.org.

and for trey, by the way,

i gave you trade up retard.

right? yeah. he also has tray a code for greensborough.org.

 26:21  
this is code for greensborough. business, i'd say send it to gab to send it to their code for greensborough emails. okay.

 26:45  
i mean, i don't think so. just the like, there's a, there is a disconnect between the role that code for america wants brigade leaders to play and the support that code for america provides two says brigade leaders. right. so it's like, code for america without the brigades is just a fellowship program, and a small team of researchers, you know, and, and that's, that's great, too. and that advances the, you know, if you're one of those researchers, right, you're one of these specialists working on code for america's core team. and i think that that is amazing. and the potential of doing work throughout the country, and replicating civic tech work through the brigade network, is also amazing. however, it's never going to be able to happen, unless brigade leaders are recognized as being part of code for america's core team in that same way, right. so i'm not saying make me a full time employee, right. i, i am not saying make every brigade a, you know, a local affiliate with paid staff. right. but when i year after year, give the feedback. i mean, it's only been two years now, realistically, but i'm glad that i've expressed this, i think, because the first year i went to brigade congress, and that was about my first experience with the brigade, right? i had just signed on not too long before that. but then as the brigade leader in 2019, i noticed like, hey, this doesn't make any sense. we've just organized so hard for national day of civic hacking. and now we're organizing to send people to brigade congress and support that. and like, wait, what happened to all of the support that code for america was providing to national dave civic hacking projects? oh, all those people now have to organize a fucking conference. that doesn't, it doesn't make any sense to have brigade congress back to back with national day of civic hacking, unless there's a different organizing structure and a different way to staff those. but the staff of code for america was stretched so thin, that then they couldn't help support us as brigade leaders in taking our national day of civic hacking project to the next step. yeah. so i provide this as an example of ways in which i don't know who else if anyone else has provided feedback like that. but basically what i'm saying is as brigade leaders, we see things like that on the ground in ways that code for america might not. and for a while, we had the regional brigade network meetings. so we had the we had like the south brigade meetings, laura. laura, you know who i'm talking about laura probably was on the neck was running those, she was stretched super thin. right? and i think is isn't, isn't really involved anymore because of how burnt out that organizing. got her. i don't know her situation and everything, right, i just know that. for a while she was running it, she looked to new leaders to help run the regional networks. and it hasn't really been the same, and with the same consistency since she stepped out. but we don't have like, a way besides maybe a brief survey or this opportunity to communicate things like that to code for america and be like, hey, over here in the small brigades, like, we're trying to communicate things to you, please listen, because we're not doing that well. and i love that hack for la, and beta nyc, are killing it. and they're 501 c threes, and they're getting grants, and they have paid staff. but i listened into that brigade 2.0 workshop during brigade congress. and honestly, i have been getting more and more pissed off about it. since then, like,

let's not frame our half of our mission, speaking in terms of code for america's potential reach, like, as something that is most accessible and doable for big cities, right? where there is the civic tech ecosystem to support having paid staff. and i know that it's probably not like, a walk in the park for the people who run hack for la. you know, just throw it that was the first one that came to mind because it's where you are, and it's where cfa is around abouts there. and it was that was the person hosting that brigade 2.0. and i asked on the chat in the brigade 2.0 meeting, like, what about small and medium sized cities who aspire to brigade 2.0. but the civic tech ecosystem is not really there to support it. like, we've had myriad community partnerships, where it's like, it's a small local nonprofit, and they got pulled into something else, right? or life happened and our leaders got pulled into something else. and we just that project didn't really see the light of day, because one or the other of these factors. meanwhile, we have no recruitment pipeline. and i am i brought this up with cc and she's like, well, what are you doing on like, social? how are you promoting stuff? and i'm like, what am i doing? everything that i can to survive? you know, and, and so as ccn so are the hack for la people. but somewhere along the line, there is something more that we could be doing to support our local brigades. and, you know, it's like, incumbent on us as people who understand technology and how to work together and collaborate effectively, to, to use technology to amplify social good, it's incumbent on us to figure it out. and i just want to see that succeed. yeah. not to mention, i mean, there is a selfish thing here, right? that like, i would love to get paid, and be able to really do this at 10 hours a week, right? for 15 or $20 an hour. you know what i mean? as a contractor, like that is what code for america should do. and yes, it's gonna be a quite a bit of money. but tech billionaires are leaving the rest of us behind. and if if code america isn't part of the way to equalize that through philanthropy, then we just need to get rid of this idea that we can equalize the wealth, big wealth gap through anything other than aggressive government action, like code for america should exist. and i'm getting on a soapbox here that's flimsy. and i might fall through it during this, the rest of what i'm about to say, but it's more or less of a soapbox. i don't know what a soapbox actually even is. but it's like a, i'm standing on a pallet here that one of the boards is cracked, and i'm about to fall through. because i don't have such a solid foundation to stand on code for america's not existentially a wealth gap equalizer. but it's one of these organizations that's in the right place, at the right time to play a major role. so if this social capitalist republic can survive, then it has to do so by channeling the wealth accumulated by people like jeff bezos into the social good through organizations like code for america. and if it if we can't make that happen, then we need to just start over. it's been a great experiment, the american experiment, and we can conclude an experiment, write a report and start a new one. if it's if we can't figure out how to how to make it work. that's where it was. that's where my foot felt, though. the round board on the on the thing and now everyone's laughing, but that's okay.

and, yeah.

so mari, that's, uh, that ran for the last eight minutes. that's the rest of what i have to say.

 37:09  
unless you have any follow up questions,

 37:37  
number one, i don't mind if my answers can be fully public.

unknown speaker  37:42  
okay. got that

 38:19  
your ballot. i have i will be voting tomorrow morning. in person at an election site.

 38:31  
there are like 19 early voting sites in guilford county, which is a pretty great number for the number of people who live in this county like a million and something. yeah, it's pretty geographically dispersed to okay. i'm going to go to go vote gso.org. and actually tell you how many early voting locations there are because we have a map for it. good the scan tool, a 910 1112 1314 1516 1718 1920 2122 2324 25. early insights throughout guilford county, and then there are more polling places on election day.

 17:14  
yeah. what else. ah. ah, i don't know. ah, aah, engaging people who like what to do about people who are basically just kind of here for tech practice. like we get people who are like oh i'm doing a coding boot camp, so i figured i should go to code events, and i saw code for dc so i'm not here. like, people who like they're not really in it for like the civic component, which is fine, you know like, well, but i like i get how people, you know people are just searching on meetup for things and you know they find lots of meetups and this is one of them. yeah,

 19:08  
it's just like, i don't know. i don't know, it'd be nice. they were cared about the thing more, but it's like i don't like i don't blame them for, like, it's like, like, i'm not going to blame someone who is like trying to get a new job in a certain field for trying to go to all these different events that relate to that field, you know, that seems very logical to me. so,

 19:43  
yeah, and some of them can convince you know like once they discover this stuff, they're like oh this is cool like yeah i like the idea of doing this. so just yeah how to deal with that.

 20:01  
yeah. another point is how to deal with project ideas for which we are not a suitable place,

 20:19  
that one brought up, and people are interested in starting projects that are probably too political for us.

 20:39  
ah,

i mean so well okay this gets into a broader question about like politics, generally, and i know like i've been to brigade events over the years, where we've had discussions about this and it's always a hot topic. let's see. i mean, so we have an active. we have an extra longest running project is a project that is basically our partner organization is an abortion fund that okay money to people to get abortions. okay. the project is doing a thing to help them. but then like i don't know like it's in like january of this year, or february. we were approached by people who wanted basically to partner with an organization called the stop police terror project. okay, that was looking to advocate around specific legislation.

unknown speaker  21:48  
okay.

 21:51  
so, yeah. okay, so

 22:04  
about like, if their end goal is like a specific piece of legislation. that's not like you know meta civic tech thing. i just, oh i don't know about this.

 23:06  
cultivating a sense of community online.

 23:57  
it's like, yeah, sir. i don't know what all right, do you have anything specific in mind in terms of processes or practices.

 24:30  
i'll say yes.

 26:34  
this might be it. it's like, i don't know. ah, it's the kind of thing where it's like if i heard of a certain practice or like caution about how to do something. i might think of like, oh yeah, we have a way for that. but like, i don't know, i don't really have like a list of things off the top of my head.

 26:58  
i thought i saw, whoever it was that sent me the email today or yesterday it was like think about this, like, i tried thinking about it and i was like, i don't really know, you know.

 28:04  
nope. okay. that works slide decks, we actually so this was inspired by a year ago in cleveland at brigade congress. people from civic tech toronto presented some different things about how they run the organization, including their slide deck. and so we actually ended up copying there's. oh, okay, meet our needs and we've continued to modify. but yeah, it's inspired by others.

 28:44  
i don't really have documentation.

 29:37  
i'm sorry. can you say that again.

 30:01  
sure, isn't a yes or no question am i giving a number. just

 30:08  
okay.

unknown speaker  30:09  
like,

unknown speaker  30:10  
whatever write

 30:13  
yes, i guess i don't know what exactly what were the first three things in the list, something format like formatting of what. just like how

 30:30  
oh this is meta. okay, um, or peer review or user testing just

 30:39  
review of a guide to begin practices, or peer review of something inside the beginning

 31:02  
sorry it froze for a second, would you say,

 31:18  
yo, that would be helpful i don't really know how to specify like what specifically would be helpful but yes.

 31:38  
oh i thought it was a collective like i yes to all. all of the above.

 32:02  
all of the above.

 32:24  
you should contact me.

 32:39  
i think, i think that's it.

 33:41  
i am the director,

 33:56  
oh, geez. ah, what counts as an active member.

 34:29  
i don't know it's really, it's really transia. it's like every time. it's like, at least a third of the people are new, oftentimes half the people will be new. so it's, i don't know, it's really tough to say, we saw our normal attendance, i don't know if this is also in your list of questions. but our normal attendance is around like 15 or so. on the virtual, we are getting like 30 to 35 in person. but since virtual it's, it's usually around 15. but like some of those people will never see again. some of them are new. so i don't know, like when i say 15 active members, that's a totally made up number but

 35:24  
directly. what's the question,

"," 37:11  
sure, i mean it's like most of it wouldn't really be relevant to them. right, like because most of them aren't managing the brigade. and so, yeah.

unknown speaker  37:28  
i think like it would

 38:12  
we're not. there were three of us go captains, in december, and now there's just one of me. and, like, half the leadership team has disappeared. beyond. so, if. no, probably not. it's basically me running things now.

 39:37  
am i giving a number right now. are you going to give a list of things that i should answer this for. okay.

okay. yeah, let me find that. yeah, basically, that's another option if like zoom doesn't work, you can do it on your phone.

 8:13  
yeah, zoom is a very finicky program, i think we've all discovered this past couple months. yeah,

 9:04  
yeah, i just, i just bought a new one myself so i understand that transition.

 11:10  
okay, well, it's always nice for metrics.

unknown speaker  11:22  
just do.

 11:31  
there we go.

unknown speaker  11:32  
okay, can you see it here.

"," 12:31  
um, i would say, one.

 12:52  
okay, you say

"," 13:02  
um, let's say, like one again, a week, like ours came together really well this year. we're actually teaming up with coker seattle do another one at the end of this month.

so, yeah, it's that that one note well

yeah last year was a little rough but this year we got it off just fine. even with like all the tech, you know, all the issues that come with covid.

"," 13:36  
oh my gosh this is like one of the things that we're always like, they're so wishy washy, and, like, they're like, some of the least reliable people to work with, like, i mean, example i'd be useful. so three. but i've just like a good successful relationship, but like to give an example we just built this whole application for the health department. and we got it to mvp, and then they were just like we don't have time to work on this anymore so we're gonna kill the project, which, you know, it's like that's a lot of time invested in our end. and it just very frustrating that that kind of stuff happens. but yeah.

 14:36  
wrong. yeah, i mean, yeah, we we've we, the problem is not getting the partner on board initially it's getting them like over the last. finish line, like consistency with them, you know.

"," 14:58  
those we could definitely

use more like you some examples of or.

yeah, i figured we could probably do this better.

i mean nonprofits are pretty easy to get on. we've had we have good luck with them. but just, it's uh yeah i mean, there's some guidance would be would be helpful. it's a little bit it's more of a it's a different

 15:39  
i wouldn't say that. because in the end of the day our most successful relationships have been with like computer new partners like nonprofits or local universities, things like that.

"," 16:11  
oh you know we've never tried anything like that before. we don't do a lot of workshops. so that might be a good thing to have an example could be useful, like that's kind of something we want to

explore in the future.

yeah, like coming up with projects really isn't too hard, it's the just getting somebody getting all the people on board to do it,

that we're having trouble with.

 16:44  
yeah, i don't really have an answer for this one. yeah.

unknown speaker  16:48  
yeah.

"," 16:59  
um, you know we could have used an example of how to do this yesterday. lately, i mean, i'm using the like number five, but like in the past, like we, i mean there's a lot of trial by fire to figure out how to, like, set up our projects, correctly. we got a good system out now and it works really well. but that was like a, you know, a lot of time and a lot of

inconsistency we had.

and, but now we, you know, getting our methodologies down was, was a little difficult.

 17:43  
yeah, put five yeah.

"," 17:50  
i was fine with that.

"," 18:15  
know we haven't had any problems. yeah.

 18:49  
yeah, i would like a reference manual how to like, proceed.

 18:58  
i mean, we have god like our code of conduct, is we've you know just forked it off of cfaes. and we are trying to enforce it. but that i mean like i said that hasn't been an issue everybody who comes to our. yeah. so we haven't had an instance yet where we need to like be that type of person. and

unknown speaker  19:26  
you never know like

 19:33  
yeah, let's do four. yeah.

"," 19:50  
yeah, we've pretty solid core team.

"," 20:01  
oh, i could definitely use that

unknown speaker  20:04  
five. okay.

"," 20:12  
um, i'd say five as well. that's something we're like, testing out. trial by fire type thing. okay.

"," 20:31  
oh, definitely number five on that one,

that one is like probably our biggest challenge.

unknown speaker  20:37  
okay, yeah.

"," 20:58  
um, we didn't. um, i can't say before, like that would have been. that would have been useful. if we had especially for github, because a lot has changed in the past year and after they were acquired by microsoft and they added a whole bunch of new tools that we found super useful. but it took a while to figure out what everything was and where it was. so like, yeah, i'd say. see, like let's say three on that one. okay. yeah, because there might be stuff we're not even, we don't even know about yet.

"," 21:42  
three on that one as well. um, that's been something where, kind of, i think we need a more concrete media strategy, honestly.

"," 22:08  
for, i would say,

"," 22:21  
um, that would be great. i'd say.

unknown speaker  22:27  
three.

unknown speaker  22:29  
three. okay.

"," 22:37  
oh, we're doing that pretty good. so

i'd say one

unknown speaker  22:45  
thing going well.

unknown speaker  22:47  
yeah. even with

unknown speaker  22:49  
zoom being wonky,

 22:52  
it's added a different like

flavor to our like meetings, but for the most part it's working out.

 23:06  
yeah, like we don't have to go to like a fixed place and i think it's actually, like, in some ways we're getting some, like more work done. honestly, because there, there's less distractions

unknown speaker  23:22  
in person nights. yeah.

 23:25  
but yeah, it's, yeah we got that done pretty good. that's good. okay,

"," 23:38  
we could always use more help with that was pretty. sorry my dog is begging for food right now. i know, portland is the less diverse community. so the more people we

saw what he broke up there.

unknown speaker  23:56  
it's not very diverse in portland,

 23:59  
no no no, it's, it's pretty white here. oh, yeah. so we try to do what we work with like women in code, and any other group that we can reach out to, to kind of pull people in, we have senior members of our leadership team, who are female. express female i guess would be the technical term. and we're trying to like, you know, include more diversity there but yeah, any sort of guide or anything would be very helpful.

 24:48  
um, yeah it's a, you know, if we had any questions or anything like that they've been answered. but it's yeah it's it's it's a difficult one for any, like if you're trying to i mean it's like, you can have the like our, our goal is to be this way but like actually getting the people there is something where we're challenging, you know, is more challenging.

 25:21  
yeah let's do it let's do it like get to i think might be better.

"," 25:33  
yeah, that'd be better if we could like we try to do our best with that but like anything like, you know, three or five, even would be perfect for that.

 25:49  
which ones for. yeah, let's just do four. yeah.

"," 26:04  
for for that one as well because we don't do like we help people when we can and we've actually helped people land jobs but we're not like i'd really like it if we could do a more of a.

like,

junior code camp type thing

to help people in their careers.

"," 26:45  
uh, no nothing i can think of at the moment i think we covered everything that all the stuff that you know major stuff that we cover in our meetings, and then some. so i'll actually have new things to talk about next admin meeting.

 27:04  
yeah, i wouldn't say so.

"," 27:45  
yes.

 28:16  
i think it just one would be like something like right now. the way things are going. i'd say one by one.

 30:23  
yeah, like the the zoom meetings we run.

i think that'd be a great thing do that enough other brigades are having issues, they might not, at this point, they've been doing it for almost seven, eight months so they might have all the things but i think it's something we're doing pretty well. so if there's something we can share that maybe other brigades can use.

like i think that might be good, but.

 31:03  
you know i really should write it like write down, write this down. uh, no, no, it's just something that kind of evolved organically. so we haven't had as much like we haven't documented, like the processes yet.

 31:27  
yeah, i think that actually be a good idea.

like it might be one one we have a minute. no.

unknown speaker  31:37  
okay.

 32:00  
peer review

user testing, and

i'd say yeah formatting would be nice too.

 32:37  
um, you just shoot me my regular email, we'll be fine.

 32:57  
yeah this point. i think that's the only one i'm like, that one's set in a good place. like i wouldn't change anything about it. or like, i don't see a lot of like need for improvement and so yeah that'd be my one.

 33:27  
oh, cathy 10.

so i'm the founder and main organizer, i suppose, and i've managed the projects, so i handle the day to day. i help people onboard. occasionally, or at least get them in like, you know, into the pipeline answer any questions and provide main point of contact for projects,

be you know outside of the project manager itself.

so like a point of contact with the client. um, general organization strategizing and

some branding work,

a lot of hats a lot of hats,

 34:28  
unbelief it's getting this thing started was basically a full time job for two years.

 34:48  
yeah, there's anything that needs like immediate attention, especially you know put out fires. there are too many these days, but, you know, make sure everybody's on the same page. you know, call meetings i also run all the meetings that we do.

unknown speaker  35:07  
so,

unknown speaker  35:09  
okay,

 35:13  
yeah i run, i run a project as well. okay.

unknown speaker  35:19  
okay. and what do you do in that project.

 35:24  
ah, let's see, did back end architecture, a lot of coding, and as well as project management. okay. yeah.

 35:43  
it's two pi like. it kind of expands like attracts like i'd say between 20 and 40. um right now.

 36:00  
yeah yeah it's it's about about where we are.

 36:10  
since we started back in. let's see. i think officially we like started the brigade in

september of, 18. yeah.

 36:40  
i might have looked at it initially because i think we had a meeting with veronica at the start, but i didn't really use it as my template or reference material that's, that's probably more the question you're asking.

 37:01  
i've. i haven't looked at it in years i'd probably have to go digging through my email to find it on your site. oh,

unknown speaker  37:09  
yeah. yeah.

 38:08  
i'd say probably at two would be fair.

 38:24  
depending on reviewing it i'd say like a three or four, maybe let's go for. okay.

 39:19  
i'm yes but i'd like to check with them before i volunteered them for more work. okay.

and that goes.

 39:45  
i can't think of anything comes to my mind but i'll let you know like something pops up about that. okay.

unknown speaker  39:52  
okay, no problem.

 40:21  
okay, yeah.

 40:33  
um, you can be. yeah, what one is fine. yes, it's kind of a public charity thing that's a

two out there.

 41:14  
okay. um, great. well, if you know anything else from me. i hope you have a good weekend.

unknown speaker  41:21  
okay, great. you too. thank you so much. all right. have a good day. bye bye.

unknown speaker  42:03  
and, you know, getting a methodologist.

unknown speaker  42:09  
okay, so i'll put like five

unknown speaker  42:10  
for this one. yeah. okay.
