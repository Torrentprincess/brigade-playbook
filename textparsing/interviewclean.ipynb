Not Patrick, haha. Okay. Um, okay so thanks for taking time to talk with me today. So as we mentioned in the invite we expect the outcome of this project to be a source of effective examples for each and every Brigade, we might refer to the brigade organizers playbook as the BOP over the next 30 minutes or so I'll be asking you a series of questions in three parts. To learn more about your brigades needs effective practices and infrastructure, the audio from this video will be recorded and then deleted as soon as we transcribe and collect collate sorry the data. If you prefer not to be recorded we can reschedule and have someone else on the call to take notes as we go. Okay. Is it okay if I record the audio. Okay, Cool. Start that. All right. Okay, so you're good to go. All right, so we will ask you at the end of the interview how public you want your answers to be made. The level of disclosure will be completely in your control, because we want you to answer freely. You can also completely opt out of any of your interview data being used at any point, we would like to send you a copy of your specific answers at the end of the interview. Okay, so you could either send me in the chat your email or say it out loud whatever is easier, and I can just shout it to you. Perfect. Um, yeah my work emails probably the easiest to check at the most. But my last name. As you can see on the screen it's difficult to spell that. Oh yeah, it is nice that it's on the screen, though.\n",

So, I believe I get let's see what can I confirm what brigade you're in. I'm currently with code for Durham, however, and trying to transition out of that leadership. Okay, into another one or just totally out no yeah just kind of time for a break have been with brigade for about four years, I was also chair code for America's National Advisory Council, and I was on the council for two years and then chair at least for a year so just kind of time for a break. And yeah, that makes sense. Feels extra. Yeah, it's just, just, you know, kind of temporary break. Yeah I know you've done a lot of work, it sounds like that's okay. Um, so you just sent it in the chat so I will just copy your name. From there, how do you say your last name. Be digger.\n",

      "I just did volunteer but you're not getting paid well right but like this is all new to me like I'm not part of a brigade or anything. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm sure you'd rather probably someone who is but I'm like, I'm that helps to ask like questions that you know clarify, you don't take things for granted. Right, yeah, I, um, I don't even know I mean, I'm in Lafayette, Louisiana and I don't know that we have one, like I'm looking on this list, how, how did you look up on this call, I don't mean to take all that but like, yeah, yeah. Well, okay, so I'm sure I'm like, whatever breaking protocol but, um, I am trying to break into UX research, and I know I am doing a lot of volunteer projects to kind of like get my feet wet. Um, so you know what we're doing right now is a user interview. Right, yeah. And so, I am just Yep, volunteering, I do find out about it. Um, I think it was on a Slack channel. So, like, Oh, I know right uh like the Slack channel was called UX rescue and then, um, you know, like they present projects and you you volunteer and then so one of the big needs was Code for America. And, yeah, it's very intense I didn't realize like I think I had heard of it before but I didn't realize that there were like local chapters and how intense it was, yeah, there's there's a group in New Orleans. That's pretty cool if you have a chance I mean, they're probably so meeting online. And the guy who had been leading it works for Ted, like the TED talk so Oh cool. Also, we this this probably doesn't happen but what am i friends, families is from. I think is from Lafayette her last name is juristische now but her mom's maiden name. I can't. Joan can't wrote her, her maiden name is but my friend has a lot of family in that area. So, that's cool. Yeah I know and Durham that looks like a really cool area so I'm feel like I've heard great things.\n",

      "Unknown Speaker  8:31  \n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  8:32  \n",
      "I think that's part of our city slogan somewhere. Oh, that it's like the like home where great things happen you know or like we're great things and then we'll have a press release about shootings or something. But yeah, yeah it's pretty cool. Yeah. Anyway, I'll have to connect with you more about that. Yeah, because I'm definitely I feel like everything I've understood so far about the brigade is it's like a lot of coding but I'm sure there's more to it than I realize. Yeah, yeah, that I so I don't code. So, yeah, I that's maybe they'll be part of our discussion. Okay, great. Yeah, so let's let's keep going. Okay, so let me. All right. Okay. So, all right, let me continue. Alright, so in this section we'd like to learn about your brigades knee we feel like it should. Please. Okay play huh, yeah, maybe if you spell it I can like find them on Facebook. Yeah. Be like, I know your friend, be my friend I'm getting one go. Yeah. Um, yeah, well, we'll definitely circle back. Okay, so we'd like to talk about your brigades needs for an example or model when carrying out a variety of activities devoxx. I'm going to pay something in the chat Oh yes. Okay, I see. This is like a scale for you to rate on. So, uh, okay, this will help you answer the questions with a number that corresponds to your answer. Okay, okay. All right. So,\n",

      "Okay, so you can go ahead and look that over. Okay. And I'll just read it out loud with you. So, okay, um, your rating on 0000 rating sorry would be I don't know, one would be, we do this well we don't need an example to is I don't need an example three an example could be useful for I will need an example for the future five I wish had an example yesterday and six. Now, having an example has limited my brigade. Okay, so let's just start a rating, um, alright so I will, the first question is, how would you rate based on that scale hosting hack nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is like to inform this. And to inform this, the BOP that they're calling it. Mmm hmm. So I'm not going to be good at like just sticking to the script clearly. No, that's okay. I think that's why we're recording because they're gonna go back and listen, and they like everything you're saying, Yeah, um, as I I can't First I'll say I can't imagine not wanting an example for anything. And probably actually, I'm just, I'll just be off the script a lot. Yeah, wanting multiple examples because it because it's tied to brigades that we have very, so there will never be one example that is completely it. I would say, and\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  11:59  \n",
      "none of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  12:01  \n",
      "Okay, wait so I think what I'm\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  12:03  \n",
      "saying is,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  12:04  \n",
      "no it's okay I just wanna make sure I understand so you you want examples, always no matter. Yes, always. Okay, multiple examples. Right. I think maybe the heart of the question though is sort of like do you do it well like does your brigade ever do it, do we have a grasp of events. We do not call them hacknight. Okay. And I would encourage the brigade network to think, away from that language I think several brigades have started to use something that's hacknight actually kind of has a violence and I'm just like, if you think about it like a hacknight. And I think to one of my things is getting more people in who aren't familiar with a jargon like a hacknight. So, We have been calling them sit, maybe civic hack, we have called them like civic hacking, I've seen other groups call them other things so I would say it depends on how people are defining a hacknight. And then I would also say that language that title, it should be changed. But we, we have a good grasp of them and have something but we definitely have room for improvement, it would be helpful to have. I'm not going to say examples but having more guidance would be helpful for new people onboarding that we want to get involved in in leading those sorts of regular events or gatherings. But also, so that there is a sense of commonality across across the brigades, but still flexibility within you know common, common elements of, of those things. Awesome. Just curious what you said you called it civic at nights is that just people call it maybe we've started something else to remember right now because we've we haven't done a lot in the past couple months but, I mean, again, we were trying to attract people outside of strictly the tech space. And so trying to use a language that is more approachable like. Yeah. Okay. Um, yeah I know you gave me some great feedback but for the sake of filling out. I'm just gonna put seven a. or a link they said you could choose zero but there's no zero in my form and zeros, I don't know. Yeah, which it's not that you don't know it's just, if I don't know. Oh type zero, I see, okay, you can leave. I don't know, like, three, I can I say 345 and six. I mean. An example would be useful so that overlaps with four. Yeah, and or five. Um, I didn't realize I had this box to type in. Okay so, which I'm not like gonna type every word you say because that's that's okay. That's okay. Yeah, yeah, I'm just putting an example would be useful. And I, and I would say my multiple examples but I don't even know that I would call it an example. I think having something like core elements and kind of like, this is supposed to be for like a playbook but like kind of like a toolkit or examples of other things, you know like theme nights, for our hack nights we have like socials twice a year, so kind of thinking beyond that thing and I know other parts of other brigades are the roles on a hacknight. Yeah, yeah, how to promote them it's it's it's a lot beyond just example I think that's, that's nice. But yeah, you're basically saying don't just tell us how to run it, tell us how to like do it all like promote it. Name it correctly, what to do during the event. Yeah, yeah. Okay, it's like a how to guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  16:18  \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  16:20  \n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  16:21  \n",
      "Good. All right, so next up is, um, the conversation is moving today's of action. So, for example, the National Day, National sorry Day of Civic Hacking this past September, how would you rate or discuss that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  16:40  \n",
      "Um.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  16:45  \n",
      "Example business. Um, we do less well on this. And so I would also maybe if changing this in the future. I think that they should change, like how people feel about their performance in this activity that might also help identify where people will feel like they need more guidance. And we do less wellness so again I would say, 3456, but definitely six, probably. Yeah, I think that time is, this is just other thoughts on that topic that time of year I think it's difficult for us. There is no good time of year recognizing those things we used to have them during the summer, I think, to me, that was a little bit easier to organize. In a however I know that like schools being away there was like less of a, sometimes it vacation time or. We have a lot of colleges in the area so we couldn't attract, you know, as mean university students, but September to me feels like a weird time because people are still getting back to school here. And there's a lot of adjustment and getting back to school, especially again. In college, like you're just getting started with courses. So, and that involves planning as late summer I think that that time of year is, is, I don't know if it's been the time of year that we have been less engaged in. Um, yeah, I would definitely say an example in that space. Yeah, just like you said before an example or a how to guide would be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  18:27  \n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  18:31  \n",
      "Yeah, I think the assumptions to that, be that there's guidance on all of these things, if it's something that is to the level of the network recognizing it and kind of assuming that all brigades are considering participating in them. There should be guidance on that, like, that's why we're having this conversation. Yeah. Can I ask like what, how does it run now so like for instance this whatever it was National Day of Civic Hacking where they just kind of like hey this is the purpose of the event, go do it. I mean, was it that on organized. Um, I have been less involved in this years last years, I think there was a good bit of work to try. So, in the past, it's been kind of a day, and there were no more opportunities to pick a topic. Locally, and I think in the past few years the network has worked more towards focusing on specific topics to work on which I, I fully support and I think it's really good if like, you know, focusing our efforts on if it's criminal justice, or it's not as much, climate change, but like, if it were climate change or things like that like, you know, having a clear focus for that are issues across the country. So one year I think they're like last year. Again, the one I know more about they focus kind of on criminal justice and then that, then you have the fun wrench of like different states do everything differently so what are activities that we can do locally, but I think having, I think for this, and for the hacknight it's probably starting with a clear purpose of what you're trying to accomplish at those events. So, so for like the hacknight is the hacknight again like for some reason I've Lizzie Borden in my head when I hear like hacknight, but like, Is it hacknight. Something that is just like the doing of the work of just like coding and commits or you know whatever the thing is, or is it more of an opportunity to lessen a pandemic but like more an opportunity to bring people into the fold. And it could be both of those. But like for us, I think we found some of our most active projects still actually didn't do that much work on hacknight, but it was a good chance to catch up with the team, their team and I had also been featuring speakers from the area to come and learn about civic topics and tech topic topics together so it was kind of more hours, hours linked more towards a social time, probably. So I think that gets back to like that, what is your purpose for these events for the National Day of Civic Hacking. Similarly, is your purpose. And again, it could have multiple, but is your purpose to get a lot of things done, or is it again because, like big events that have a national presence because you know we can co promote it on this national level, and kind of work on similar things across the state, that could be a great opportunity to help again bring new people in like when you have, you know, big National Volunteer days and stuff like that. So that could be an opportunity to, you know have additional partnerships locally with other criminal justice organizations and maybe he has normally held like on Saturdays, you know, bring in some of the groups that are only protesting outside of our county jail, like bring them in to our meetings because maybe they don't normally attend to hacknight, but they see that we're talking about mapping the criminal justice, you know, like doing a journey map of the criminal justice, you know, process or, or things like that. Um, I don't know where I started where that conversation started but I think a lot of it is to be clear about what the purpose is if it's doing the work, or if it's bringing people together. Again, I think you can do both of those but those are different things. And I, this is a larger theme for me and the work that the network is doing is that, I think it's really important to bring different people into this space to do this work, and especially in this isn't even the net network promotes a lot and Code for America is bringing people who are affected and impacted by the problems that we're trying to solve people who are at the center of these problems, really bringing them like not maybe even maybe it's not even so much us bringing them in but like us, joining them in their like fight in Germany against these things. So that's often people who probably don't feel comfortable showing up to tech events and would have no idea about like cool user experience, interviews, like you're doing right now, but they are crucial, like they are the most impacted by what we're doing or could or could do and they're the most knowledgeable, to\n",
      "\n",
      "answer, I think, I think being clear about what the purpose is for a National Day of Civic action and I don't know what happened this last year, I'll be honest, I can't really speak to like how, you know, how much the network has moved more in that direction but just being clear of like what what people are trying to accomplish with these things it's not just doing stuff it's like what is the reason that we're doing these things. And who are we bringing in to the space or whose space are we joining to, to make these things happen. I also do community engagement by day so like I've been thinking a lot about like community engagement if that, so it bleeds a lot over for me. Yeah, and I can totally see you bringing in, say, like you said, like I don't know the leader of a local protest group, whatever it is, criminal justice reform, and then speaking, before you kick off the journey mapping. You know, I don't know what to call it day event, um, and just, even if it wasn't that they were doing it with you that they were just present like giving their. I guess story, you know when it's almost like inspiring and you're like yeah that's right and then you go do that, the technical part. Yeah, I think that's true but I think that they need to be a part of the work like both the people impacted and he is at work in government, the people who are doing the work. I could probably go off on a whole thing because I was listening to the news this morning and catching up on like government stuff and federal and out you know federal announcement appointments appointment and what appointment announcements, and just thinking about the role of public public servants. In, in the things that we do and that's that is something that I would like to see the network do more of it's bringing more public servants into the fold, because in some places there is a lot of discretion of the ways that we could help to advocate for things and help to help to drive change, but they're you know you can drive change from the outside with community organizing which is really powerful. You can also drive change internally and being able to bring both of those together would be really powerful. So if you're doing a journey map around like record clearance or something, it's really powerful to have like DBAs and court experts, and legal experts to speak to that. But it's also really important to have the people who've gone through that process, talk about it and talk about you know where they you know where they felt the most hurt because the things that we're doing while they're technical, they are affecting people's lives, and that is causing a lot of trauma and elevating a lot of existing trauma. And so, just as I continue, you just you just got this is my swing of the morning so it's like the coffee has kicked in. So here you go. You're welcome. sorry, whichever of them you don't have to apologize. Yeah. Um, but it's one of the things we've been talking about a lot is in some of the other work I've been doing is you know it's how you make people feel so it's one thing if you like fix a problem. But if no one knows about it knows that like their record has been cleared or they could clear their record, or they still feel like disrespected or disempowered or unseen in that process. Then it's it's still not, if you're still like at a net negative. There's a lot about like bringing you know people who are doing the work on the city on a city or government side in to what we do and bringing bringing community members into that. And both of those things require a lot of work, and that like hat back to our topic today. Um, I think require a lot of work and require, you know, expertise from different perspectives. So, I have a somewhat understanding of how to maybe reach some city employees or different community organizations and other brigades may not have you know how to do that. Other members of my brigade don't necessarily know how to do that so having guidance on, you know how to approach people how to talk with them, how to build relationships because this should probably be relationship building first and then getting down to like doing the work. Yeah that's that's really cool and like you said you have that kind of in it sounds like because you work for the government you're just familiar with the process and comfortable. Oops. Um, but yeah, for other people I could see how to guide being really, really helpful. Awesome. Alrighty.\n",

      "so we're just you know it's going to be like every. Oh my gosh. So this is exactly what you're just talking about cultivating partnerships, I'm just going to copy and paste everything you just like that part of what you just said, oh you read it I might have something to add on both so we read the question. Oh, it's it's very it's it's just like you. They want you to wait cultivating government partnerships. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  28:35  \n",
      "Um,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  28:38  \n",
      "yeah i mean i don't know that we really do that again and again for pretty much anything I can't imagine not wanting an example of something that's come to the level of of this discussion. So I would be a three to six on all of them. Okay, so I just decided no whichever those you want to write and it had consistently, I guess I would go, I always want more information on those on these things and I'm not have yeah I think it would definitely be helpful. I'm cultivating government partnerships, the same thing. And it, and I think this in what I was talking about earlier, it is helpful to have a playbook and this is actually a question I wrote down for I realize that you're kind of doing this on a volunteer perspective so you don't have this lens on it, a written guidance and like it's like having policies and procedures or stuff like that are helpful, but these things still need, you still need training in these like you because this is like I think to me that, at the essence of all this work is our people, and in requires relationship building, there is a piece that like you can't just write down, you know copy this email and send it to this staff person. Because a lot of stuff in local government can vary from can vary from government to government. And it's not just contacting the director of the technology department, that's going to be you're in, in our city that would not be your in at all. Um, so there's a lot of nuance to things and I think there's almost like an element of definitely training on how to do this ongoing training and kind of like forums for people to talk about know what they've learned in town, and potentially like coaching or mentoring across brigades as well. All right. Deal. All right, what about the community partnerships, same thing cultivating community partnerships is it kind of all the same. Yeah. Yeah, I think it is I, um, let's see, what is this specific question Is it just says it's just a phrase cultivating community. Um, yes definitely. I mean community partnerships is a very broad phrase, again, you, we, I think it's easy for us to build partnerships with people that are already represented their brigade so we have like a lot of tech people already, and then a few government people so like it's easy for us to make those partnerships. Again, we don't have as many of the people that are directly impacted by these things so the people that we really need to be in partnership with that, again, that needs a lot of help, and that needs relationship building and trust because these are communities that are like doing a lot of fighting on their own and fighting against the system. And, and there's a lot of relationship and trust building that you need to do there but instead of just like jumping into a project. I also think, and this is probably bringing a lens from work that I'm currently doing with our city is when we've done engagement as the city we rarely resource communities like we rarely compensate, community leaders to lead engagement we don't we pay these consultants and we pay people from outside our city to come in and talk to communities and ask them who they should talk to you and hold meetings and things like that. And none of the community members get any kind of payment, they don't get any kind of like you know spawning new even sometimes like maybe food, like for a meeting but not, you know, not much assistance in that way. And I think, I think that. Similarly, if we're going to do community partnerships that we need to really think about how we can do that, probably also in providing resources in, not that aren't just like our volunteer time but what, like, and I don't, I don't have a clear answer for that one but I think about how like how we're actually showing, like a real commitment to these groups and providing some sort of like resources for the things they do if it's if it's helping them to build their website or do something that like isn't immediately the fix to us but it's a demonstration to them in our relationship of, of how we're willing to be there and support them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's something to think about like what is that because a partnership is like your group like two people working together so I feel like we talk about partnership and like how do we bring people in to help us do the work that we're trying to do. And I think we might need to shift that a little bit of like, I think part. The other piece of partnerships are that I think all of our projects need to have partners, and probably all of our projects need to start with partners, in a way, it doesn't need to be just what we and brigade identified as an issue for us if it's not something that is part of a larger community issue or strategy, and it's like, I know like code for Asheville does things like that like that, they're, they had they went out, they. A couple years ago they took time to go out and visit in person to, you know, community meetings and other spaces and hear like what the, you know, group advocating for the homeless people like what, what were their needs, and that may not be like a super sexy tech project but it was something that helps them. That was something that was meaningful to that group and needed and helps them, I think, to build a long, like a longer and stronger relationship. That's good. Um, I definitely hear what you're saying like, kind of meeting the need instead of hoping fixing one like figuring out what it actually is and partnering people to get it done, fix it. And it's not like a partnership just for an event or anything like that it is like a longer, again, it's to me there is a relationship like it's, you are working with this group for long term, we have a project that did kind of start with a government agency, working on clearing clearing criminal records or clearing records. And now they're working really closely with the legal aid in in their local area, and that's that they're basically the client, in this case, but that's been a really like that's over a year now. So that's been really, that's not, not like that's the best example but like they are at the table like this group meats they're, they're like a client to them and they meet with them regularly to, you know, understand, and continue to like problem solve on things. So, yeah, so you're drained basically of that community partnership. Kind of happening, or more in line with what you're hoping for and if oh no it's not it's not the same community level but is definitely impactful. So yeah, that's good. Yeah. Well yeah, more of that relationship based, um, yeah and it's like if Legal Aid were to walk away this project would have nothing. And I think that we have projects sometimes that are built on like the, like, the ideas of a volunteer or a few volunteers who have like some ideas in your head about like mapping a bunch of data that sounds cool. But if you don't have like someone on the end of that that's like, it's really useful for that you're building it for a purpose. Yeah, then that volunteer walks away or or something and it's just what what were we doing that for. Oh, I mean, and like you probably put in so much work. And they do. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. One where it was. This one person and they just had a passion project for some and I that's something that I would need also examples, or help with this as a leader, how to vet and like really back certain projects and maybe not just like open space for all of them we had in the past I think some questions about once it seemed more on an entrepreneurial like business venture scale, and how that like did this fit civic tech, what, what defines the types of projects that we do, how are we like ensuring that they're open source or what are the values that we want across across our projects. But we had yeah we had one volunteer and it was working on affordable housing mapping and affordable housing is a big issue. And so people would come on a brigade night, and I for two years he worked on stuff and I never saw anything I don't know what it was. He wasn't working with anyone with our local government, I tried to connect him with some other community groups and that like didn't really pan out the volunteers would come in and be like, Oh, I want to work on that thing, and I would be like no please Oh God, because we might we're gonna we're definitely gonna lose you because you're gonna be like, I can't, I can't engage with this project. This is this guy's like dream of a thing but it doesn't it's not meeting a need. Gotcha. So, yeah, right. I could see you, you. Sorry, guidance, being helpful to choose like you said, Right, yeah. Okay, um, yeah I'm just, we have a lot left by the way so I mean, no no this is all good I just, um, I know, like you said, an hour and so I just, I don't want to keep you too long over. Okay, hosting a workshop to help partners identify user needs. I've never done that I have no idea. Yeah, I don't even quite know what that fully needs to be honest with you. Because user needs, like when you say user needs I'm thinking of a website you know because like we're doing a user interview, but I think I'm assuming they mean like what you talked about like the homeless group and like, you know, what do they need. Right. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, well you said you want examples so I'm just gonna. Yeah, yeah, I yeah it's gonna be three to three to six I can't imagine. Yeah, yeah. Any other responses so whichever of those you want to put okay you said you don't code but it says practicing lean software development. Okay, that one you might put I don't know. Okay. Yeah. Are we developing software. Um, yeah, I don't understand that one. Um, maybe you're gonna get to, and I think some of these I think I recognize as categories or specific topics from the previous playbook. So I think it could just be like taking that I do think there is a piece of like, innovative practices, or I don't know why I felt like that and did air quotes but innovate gives it's like some of the stuff isn't innovative anymore but a lot of stuff is innovative to government and even like, you know, community groups but like, I'm like, I think agile, or in the city we just call it, we use regularly called things like iterative approaches. I think that that piece of like that kind of approach to work, and like, let's just try something. Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I see, got to kind of take a stab at it. Okay, um, another probably category conducting user testing, I don't know if you would have ever done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we did a little bit with, with a little bit bit bit, they did a little bit with\n",
      "\n",
      "some of the project like the record clearance project that I talked about. He and I think that's an opportunity to build relationships with people that are impacted by these things, and these are communities that work with a lot who are over surveyed, and over researched and if that if that if the user experience doesn't have like user testing doesn't have some sort of compensation or some way for them to be involved. I think that kind of repeating core practices.\n",

      "so, Code of Conduct what happens after the fork, creating strategies for how to deal with Code of Conduct violations. Wow. Yeah, I don't know what what happens after the fork is but I would assume. I know the fork has to do with like GitHub, so I don't know if that's a new language that they're using now for code of conduct. I don't know, I'm so funny, what's what happens after the fork. Uh, I think that the heart of the question is just sort of like what happens, or I'm sorry, how to handle the Code of Conduct violations which I don't know how you guys handle that. But how do you really correct an adult in a volunteer project, you know like,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  42:01  \n",
      "there you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  42:04  \n",
      "It's, it's true. And I also think it comes down to who the leadership is in the spaces so I think a lot of it can be accountability very few things I didn't understand what the code of conduct was for a long time. We are very like this, this, this word feels too informal but it like we're very like ragtag group of people and it's like people who step up to want to do this, which is really great. But sometimes the people who stepped up to do that mean like probably need more leadership training and. And I don't mean as in like them to be strong leaders but them to be like compassionate leaders. And so I think a lot of code of conduct issues can come back to you know what environment has been set how, you know, those things need to be caught early is what are one of the you know it's one of the things and this is a group of people doing this on a volunteer level. Um, and I think having to have like honest conversations, I feel like I'm, I can be pretty Frank person but having to speak, and as a woman to speaking about like when someone makes me feel comfortable, how I can feel like I can speak just speaking to another person about that like do I have the space to say like, maybe it's just me but like that person kind of makes me feel uncomfortable like, I don't want it you know I don't wanna rock the boat on that so I think there's a piece on having training on photo contact, but a lot of that I think needs like like a personnel infrastructure reinforcement like you need you need to have people need leaders and people who end members who are holding each other accountable need to have awareness and regular reinforcement of the code of conduct, but you also need to have like support, when you think that something is going wrong. So, yeah, good, I like that. But we're\n",

      "making it feel like\n",
      "\n",
      "they should almost never be like just coming back to the playbook on that, if there is anything that is coming to that level, it needs to be a discussion with a person, and probably someone who is a little bit removed from the situation who can help to like, you know, provide like clear guidance. Right. That's good. It's like the section of that playbook is like call somebody. Right, right. And like you said I mean really, the more you make it formal, to me, the worse it is because it feels more serious it's like oh my god like I'm doing my thing three people, counting me you know. Yeah, yeah. well and even just guidance on how to speak about it so normally at the beginnings of meetings as that has always been a thing of of like referring to the code of conduct, I don't, I think I've read it now at some point but like it needs to be easier for people to understand at a glance, and instead of just like referring to the Code of Conduct like just you know alluding to it at the beginning of a meeting, it needs to like go over the things and it probably even like maybe in a way of like, it's not like We hold these truths to be self evident but like some sort of way of like, we're here for these things and it kind of like you know three centers you for the meeting of like, you know, in, you know, having this sort of impact and doing these things and part of that is respecting how we work together in this space, so it's it's all, it kind of ties together, the good of civic tech, as well as like how we treat each other. Awesome. Okay, next up building a core team. Yep. Yes, we've definitely helped with that. Just a lot of recruitment and engagement and marketing things. Yeah, and the playbook had like several positions for that but i, to me, a lot of these things need again like you can have playbook and write things out in a document, but you need a lot of support, again because we are volunteers doing this work so one of the things that I had said before is like if one of the positions is marketing communications, it would be really helpful to have like there's a marketing communications lead for the network, or even for like a certain region area that gets people together like that helps to keep things like the playbook updated, you know, might provide like networking opportunities or even just like you know quarterly call if you just want to like learn about like, share, you know people have stuff coming up Do you have questions are there things that we can share about like cuz if you, if as a leader or a new person if you just said to me. Hey, do you want to learn how this works and you want to like do this stuff here, read, read this document, like, that is not the way that I engage I know some people do that, I would want to join the meeting and get to know other people in the organization and learn from them and also have a group that I can reach out to when I have questions about things. And I think that the different positions that have been laid out in the playbook like a captain, or marketing person or community partnerships person, I think the positions that were laid out in a playbook also need to be re revisited, but to have, again, there needs to be infrastructure and like a social infrastructure that reinforces all these things. Okay defining a strategic plan for your brigade. I'm not I'm very interested in what you're saying I'm just trying to\n",
      "\n",
      "know I understand. I'm divine. That's awful word. What volunteers really put together a strategic plan. My so my other thoughts on this are that for some of the things that are heavier lifts, like this, or, you know, orienting the core team like starting out a new year, things like that. In addition to having like a social infrastructure network across mega network across the network. I think that there should be. I'm going to just share all my like big ideas restating them here so that, you know, whatever. There should be, like, like consulting opportunities within the network so I was in a sorority in college. And we would have. There were part like alumni who were experienced in recruitment, or fundraising, or things like that and so they had regular jobs and stuff like that but they received some kind of training from our like national organization. And then when we needed help with a specific topic, they would come out for the weekend or something and they would work with us on developing a fundraising plan or for recruitment or whatever. So for things like a strategic plan or, you know, maybe trying to lay out a big project I think that there needs to be an expertise within the organization that can help to do that. Um, but I'm not, I'm also not really sure that I want to, like, the volunteer group, the groups had been a part of I don't know the strategic plan is makes a lot of sense. I think it would be helpful to have something like annual goals. But I think a strategic plan should actually be a bigger thing set by the network as a whole, probably, um, that we are trying to achieve jointly. And then as a brigade like maybe we have goals this year of like hosting a for a big city hosting another hacknight somewhere or diversifying our membership or or things like that and that could be a discussion, a one and a half hour, or like maybe like two discussions with Code for America people to help us like identify our goals, or we share the goals that we have and they help us like to create kind of like plans for that because we're volunteer, again we're volunteers doing this in addition to all the other things we've already talked about. Right. Okay, good. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, um, I feel like it's the same thing drafting for a project I'm just gonna put see above. Yeah, I don't want projects. That doesn't make sense to me to for them to have their own trading plan, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  50:30  \n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  50:33  \n",
      "Okay, um, I'm sorry I don't I don't have like more explanation that's okay I think that we need help with project management and that's another thing of just like you're having someone helps like scope out a project at the beginning, but then you also need ongoing project management, someone who like you know holds helps you with that. I think that's another space in attracting even people like yourself into the brigade though people who are looking for project management skills because that is a very marketable skill, having more opportunities to kind of provide training like that so that helps then to re because we have a lot of coders and a good number of UX and like data people in our Brigade, we always need more project managers. So I think that piece of like when we type in coding and Durham code for Durham comes up, so like that's really great. So we've thought that, but you don't like if you're trying looking for project management. You wouldn't think that we're a group so i think i think there should be ways to, to help help build those skills internally because the know the brigades need them a lot. Right. What about fundraising. Um. Are we a small business at this point did you have, like look at all the things that we've just talked about, I know. Yeah, I mean, what would you need fundraising for. That's a great question. When fundraising comes up a lot, I, and we would talk about it sometimes here locally, I was confused. Our brigade kind of took the method of like, Yeah, what do we need fundraising for, um, we if we had what okay so we have pizza at like our hack nights every other week and we had like some servers Code for America provides a lot of resources for free. And that those were our main things, the company that we worked that we, the space where we met, he, he kind of just ended up paying for the pizza regularly. So, to me, like, I don't know that you need fundraising, maybe you need some sponsorships to help cover some things. I think that makes more sense then a whole lot of extra work fundraising specifically although I know that that seems like the same things. We had another net another brigade that did a lot more work around events and events can be very expensive. Um, so yeah I don't know why we would need fundraising, um, I think, I think it's looking at what we're trying to accomplish, where there are resources in the community that come back that, like, if it's if we're really doing the work that we're saying that we're doing we can find companies and organizations that will sponsor, those things I really believe. And I think those are minimal pieces. I do think that we need to, because everything we've talked about is basically a job like this isn't like it's not just a club clearly like this is like worse require requires a lot of time and resources and that's a barrier to people, I'll say like, more, more like people of color and low income people in our communities getting involved in this because it is so time intensive. So I think that there, there should be more opportunities like local fellowships that are working with brigades in that can do some of these things, but I don't think brigades are at a level to be doing that. I think some large cities like New York and LA can talk about fundraising for big events. I've like I'd like a T shirt. And I would be willing to like if I believed in what we were doing, locally and we're really making a difference. I would be okay. Because I am you know I have access to resources in my like immediate community and family I would be okay asking my parents to donate some money or asking people in my circle, because, because this is what we're doing and so I think the groups that we have access to a lot of capital in that way that we could get those donations and get a good bit of money pretty easily, but I think being clear about what that money is and actively asking for yeah like I don't I'm not really sure what why we're raising money so I would say it's not it's not fundraising specifically to me but I think there is a piece of like financial management and resources of like what money do we need and how you know how could we get that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  55:14  \n",
      "Yeah, good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  55:17  \n",
      "I mean, I think, yeah, you have to be clear, like you said, especially if you're asking your friends. What's it for. Yeah. Okay. Um tools to manage your brigade such as discourse, Google Groups do they need Discord. This course is like is the thing. Okay, I haven't used that one Google Groups meetup GitHub issues and slack. Yes. Okay. Need need help. Yeah, again I would, I don't know that necessarily needs to be those, and I think that they should be aligned to the people or trying to reach discourse, I know they've, it looks a little bit more organized now than it was last time, I think it's still really complicated slack is a mess to me I don't use slack on a day to day basis in the way that we have used slack or I've seen other other parts of our networking slack are overwhelming to me, I, I will dm people all day on slack but I don't even have slack open anymore I haven't had open for a few months now. So I think, I think revisiting the tools that we have and who are the audiences that we're missing that we don't have engaged What are other ways that we can do that are developing a branded media strategy. I think that we should be really closely aligned with the National Organization on that. So, I think that hat like, I think that we should be a part of doing that on a national level, and, and then like being able to share it out locally. And part of that discussion is an understanding of it we like the phrase Code for America or code for Durham, because several groups have changed their names to open Brawley, or LA is hack for LA, so I think, I think it's having, you know, having it an understanding on things like that but i think that's part of a national thing it doesn't need to be a hodgepodge of stuff. And again for the work that we do. It's not so much branding but it's probably storytelling and sharing out like the work that we're that we're doing locally, like, if, if we're really making impactful work. This is how you contact a local reporter, and probably have like set up someone who's impacted by this works talk about it as well as a project manager, and then you're able to like you know reroute them to hacknight hacknight, or another event, so I think it's more storytelling. And in alignment with a national brand or identity onboarding to the national network. Yes. Um, yeah. I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  58:12  \n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  58:17  \n",
      "And but I think a lot of things I've talked about before, are a way to do that, if you're part of a core team, and you are a product you know project management lead for your brigade or the marketing lead for your brigade or storyteller, whatever, then you are part of a collective of those across the network that is a way that is also a way for you to be onboarding to the national group, but how you also have but like if here if you are a local brigade member. Why do you want to be a part of the national organization. I think they're to be here. I think there are benefits but for some Brigade, like some people have no desire for it like so like thinking about what what what the what the Why is for that especially for people that are like the people leaving your record clearance stuff are amazing, doing amazing work. I don't think they have any desire to do stuff on the national level and that's kind of a loss to us of like trying to share that across the network but like they're doing their thing and they're they came because they have a skill and they want to do that for a positive reason, so I don't know that they have a reason to get involved with the national network so maybe not everyone does. But I think for them to, I think it would be powerful for them to feel a part of a larger thing so that they knew that this could be a part of a larger story and sharing it out beyond the project that they're currently working on and kind of helping to share that across the country. Yeah, and that just may be a cue for the network to be better about finding ways to engage them without giving them extra work, like, just dance. Yeah, and spotlighting it. Right. Yeah. So, I don't know that this will be a part of your question but one of the things I would say is that I think that the, the network does a really poor job of communicating outside of things like slack and discourse. So it's silly and, but like, just having a newsletter, just having like a weekly newsletter or having something where like just an average person can get information to you there, I joined Twitter because it's big in this space but otherwise I'd not on Twitter. Like, there's like, there's Twitter and there's slack. And if you're not on those, you have no idea what's going on in the rest of the network, I haven't been on those really for the last few months and I'm not doing stuff on the leadership level, no idea what's going on, almost nothing, no, I almost know nothing about the, the, like, like the September, you know, day. And I think there needs to be more more communication, even if it's just letting people know again of what other organs, other brigades are doing and maybe that helps because I think when there are examples like what our brigade is doing or they're examples from other places and I see that I'm like, Oh, I could take this to our health department and say, Do you also have this issue, because this other government is doing this thing and that, like, if people see that you know see success projects like that. I can forward an email newsletter really quickly, and and try to like, you know, potentially start a project that we can fork from. That's how I understand the word fork, that we can fork from another area. Yeah. I think just like more, and I think to have communications like that would also help to reinforce our community partnerships and governments because there will be people, maybe even in places where there aren't brigades who want to keep like people in government who want to keep it like an idea on innovative practices. And that helps them to learn things but also, community groups. One last note code for Australia. If you ever have time, you should check out yeah so they're, they're like, they're around the like the world code for Australia has a really great newsletter, it's just once a month but it's like packed with stuff. And I really enjoy it and I don't I don't live in Australia I don't have any, I'd love to visit sometime but like I learned what they're doing and it spots like spotlights their work they lift up the work of other people. Um, and I'm not on Twitter, or slack so I probably even know a little bit more about code for Ashley is doing actually than Code for America\n",

      "I that that's less clear to me. Um, I haven't really understood that piece of, of, when Code for America has done that, because sometimes the way that it, it looks to me is like, depending on how this can. This could not be what they're asking, but the depending on when I see that on the, on the network level, it looks like we're gonna parachute in some really great like tech people and fix your government, and no that's not what this question is really asking how but that's the way that I feel about it. Um, and the issues that we have on a local level in our tech department, or other spaces are not going to be fixed by a single person. And when I find like a really great person has been recruited whether it's through the network or not I hope to hold on to them for as long as I can. But I just, I, I say this because I don't know, I'm what that question is unclear to me, how it fits into the larger strategy. I think that there needs to be there need to be more relationship building with government, and more training opportunities for government I would rather see training opportunities for government staff to learn things about iterative approaches, or user experience or things like that. In hopes, I think that can be as much if not more influential to, you know, then just having a single person recruited to a position. So, I like that, that pieces.

      "I think that it would. I think that is something to consider because I think I mean where economy is right now is, like, I think a lot of people can't like where our economy is now kind of period. And then, even before now, there were a good number of people who would come people came to our brigade knights, either because they were just interested like it was like techies who just kind of followed us locally and they were free that night and then just came in, maybe there's a specific speaker but often it was people who are transitioning from a variety of different ages like people that are you know in college, or right out of high school, or people kind of like, you know like, this is like 50s or 60s and this is their new career and they're kind of returning this stuff. So I think that would be useful, that I think thinking about it and the larger strategy of what we're doing and how how how that happens but I think being mindful that the work that we do is very intensive and that there can be really good opportunities and how we can reinforce the volunteer work that we're doing is real work, even if people haven't been paid for it. I think that's important. Awesome. Are there any topics on this list that you would like to be covered by future versions of the BOP, and that you would like to rank as a five or six you talked about a lot. Take your time to think about this I feel like we've covered a lot of this is there anything you didn't talk about\n",

      "I think it's probably just subtopics and some other things about just don't take me more than two minutes just to think off the top of my head. Um, you can take a minute if you want. Okay. Um, yeah so I think that piece of like how you encourage people to take on leadership at to go from 14 to leadership of the other space. Um, was another thing that was just thinking. This is like again a sub topic I think how we work across brigades more. So, how I don't know, I don't really necessarily know or understand the concept completely ever remote brigade. I think that we have so many different organizations that are starting like there should be an or, there should be a brigade that people can tap into. So probably how we make our like a sub topic to the project management and remote brigade pieces how we make our projects more accessible across the network, so that they're things that I need help with that, you know, if they're, they're doing a sprint, or something like that on one topic and we can bring in people from other places to continue with that.\n",

So they're moving, or they're getting married, as in like they're out because they're planning a wedding and honeymoon, not like, yeah. And then they're having kids. So that takes people away from you know stuff that we've been doing and so being mindful of how there's always backup on these things. I'm probably thinking about how to be more kid friendly, or just how to be more how to have more inclusive events in general.\n",

We have the group that's doing record clearance, and they are very talented individuals that if, if I could put $1 amount to the amount of time that they've spent on this, they would have charged on a regular project, our job like they like our city your county would like really pay attention to that. And that's just not something we've tracked and it's not like it's not like they're making their impact as it is, but I think it being able to say like, this would be worth us doing 300,000, you know like, I don't know, that's probably even a low number, and just helping people to understand like because people are doing it for free I don't think it gets the value that it really deserves.

Yeah. And I would also say I think that beyond the national organization. I think that maybe how to have more local and regional convenings and kind of gatherings are really important because otherwise you'd become one of 100 plus brigades and in North Carolina we've had at least eight at some point. And that's really powerful when we can work together. How to lobby. I don't, I don't really completely understand that and I don't want to get very into the political space, but if there's something that we can again do and share our work on a state level, I think we have again in North Carolina, and we are really well positioned to do that. And I don't know how to do that and a lot of that could be kind of a brief statement, and this is who to contact in Code for America, like to further that not that you need to have all those laid out. Nice. All good ideas. Okay. I am about to ask a yes or no question, almost all the people we have asked before you answered yes and then started telling us more of a pressure, please just answer yes or no. No pressure.

Oh, it is yeah that's. That would have been easier way yeah yeah it was a little convoluted there okay I put yes next. Okay.

So, I think what they're saying is like hey, you have an expertise in connecting people with local government and like asking the right questions and saying the right things. Do you want someone to come in and help you formalize that process so it can be shared with others. Um, and if so, what would you meet if you want to do that. How do you need help doing that. So, um, say I am interested in contributing to someone else's doing that. A lot of this, again, a lot of the stuff that we've talked about, I think there's a piece of documentary work and pulling together documentation, updating past stuff and pulling together other things, I think, just creating a playbook is optimistically 50% of the job, if that's like that, that's not enough. Um, I, yeah. So, that is a piece of it. Yes. Very relationship based. Okay, what would the next ongoing training like you can't just you can't just release the thing like people have to. Yeah. But I, but I am generally interested in, like, reviewing and editing stuff, but\n",

      "yeah. Okay.\n",

      "Claire Salinas  1:16:47  \n",
      "All right, what would the next step be steps be for the UX team to find out more. If we had follow up questions about this practice or process again, you're the one you volunteered was the government connection. Okay. Um, oh, okay, okay. Yeah, I don't think this applies to you like they're kind of saying, I mean we kind of talked about it like what you're telling me is this is a relationship building process. It's not a form or a training. Yeah, I mean if you can provide guidance and there are some organizations I would refer people talk to me like it's something that I could talk out with someone, okay but, um, yeah, that's what I'm gonna put and they might have someone to talk it out with you. Okay. Um, okay. Do you have more practices to share.\n",

      "I mean, I am glad to talk. If there anything else. Anything else on this call that people want to have a follow up conversation about, I'm generally interested in. I'm scheduled this day for my day off and I don't know that really super excited but having these conversations on Saturdays, but I could do that too like just saying I would be interested in having follow up conversations if people are interested,\n",

      "outside of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:18:13  \n",
      "I'll also say I created a whole structure for the network. A couple of years ago that I really still really, like, and promote and I think that's something to help to create like the kind of like social infrastructure that I've talked about on this call. But other than that I don't have a specific document that I would promote or any kind of process like written process like that. You said you would promote the one that you created. Okay. All right. Cool. Okay, So what is your official role in the brigade. I don't know. I mean, officially I don't know, we don't have elected positions. I have said in the past that I'm a brigade captain, I don't really like the term captain and again I'm trying to transition from that so can you elaborate on like maybe your duties, just a couple like off the top of your head like organizing events recruiting members leading projects. I mean, at this point I seem to be the main point of communication from Code for America, and I'm trying to transition that I'm interested in trying to host more code for during meetings with government with on the government side or hosting them during the day so that they're more like staff can attend to those, but other than that I'm kind of trying to you know transition, I previously I was basically like the lead organizer scheduling speakers at our at our events and updating you know our meetup. And, and things like that. Yeah. Great. All right, roughly how many active members are in your brigade now have no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:20:18  \n",
      "Um,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:20:19  \n",
      "I think that's a really hard question because what was considered active if they just come once a year. On a good on a regular to Good night, we would have just 20 or 30 people show up without a lot of effort, which is really thinking like, that's why it was like without effort. And, and I will say, a very diverse crowd so like a good number for especially for tech space, a good number of women, and a good number of women and men of color, and which is really exciting they are normally on the younger end but other than that, we but there are also several retirees that showed up so like, just naturally we had a pretty diverse set of people, pretty much everyone looking for some sort of tech involvement. We were not really great at maintaining like keeping that keeping people engaged with it, which I think is part of a larger issue like issue of people just kind of like trying it and I would imagine for meetups and things like that maybe only half of people really stick around anyways yeah but number of people involved in projects and things like that. Right now, I don't know, I don't know, I would say under 100, for sure. Um, our meetups have been less than 10 around 10 online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:21:37  \n",
      "So maybe, I don't know, in a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:21:42  \n",
      "Maybe 10 to 15 to 20 that are actively working on some sort of projects,\n",
      "\n",
      "roughly how long is your current brigade leadership been managing the brigade. This question is to help us understand if length of leadership determines priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:22:04  \n",
      "Um,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:22:04  \n",
      "I have been involved for about four and a half years, and I have of this level leadership, I'm one of the newer ones. So, one guy's been involved since the whole time but he's kind of, kind of like, like an emeritus or he's there he's really involved with another project, he's like, we meet in his space and he's kind of involved in some stuff in the background but not definitely not actively involved in leadership Safford weekly events, another guy that was kind of plant in in weekly events I think has recently moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:22:37  \n",
      "Um,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:22:38  \n",
      "so, I'm still kind of one of the newest admin trying to bring on board. A couple of people who are interested but they still want to share leadership. Like with me. Like I just really, I just really need to step back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:22:52  \n",
      "Yeah. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:22:55  \n",
      "All right, um, have you seen the brigade, the BOP the brigade organizers playbook. If you have. Okay. Yes. All right. Um, how often you use the BOP weekly, monthly, yearly I can't remember the last time I refer to it never. I mean I'm sure I looked at in the last year when I first started doing things like four and a half years ago, I come from a background, which I feel like it's been kind of rare in my experience with other brigade members, but I come from a background of being involved in large national organizations that are distributed. So like a sorority and I worked for a nonprofit that had like local affiliates I'm very used to this model, like that. And so I immediately looked for guidance, like that. So when I my first year and then it, you know, other times in between. I've looked at all of the brigade websites, looked at all of the ones that have like any kind of guidance on, it's really easy to have a website just like them listed somewhere so it's really just click away but but then look for all the ones that have any kind of like project framework or recruitment, you know onboarding guidance or or any sort of thing like that. And so that's how I think I probably came across well the the playbook is also on the brigade website but yeah I'm, I'm familiar with many things like that because that's just the type of person that I am and how I look at leadership So, so definitely I was in a. I remember being in a. Our when our first like brigade conference thing like in Philadelphia, a few years ago and someone mentioned that in a in a in a room of brigade leaders and it seemed like half of the people never heard of it. Yeah, and I think they probably know that, too, to an extent, which is unsure why it's coming up. Okay, so follow up on the playbook. Um. All right, on a scale of one to five how helpful Have you found the I'm just gonna call it the BOP to be one is not at all helpful five is extremely helpful. Hmm. Number three. On a scale of zero to 10, how likely are you to recommend the brigade organizers playbook to other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, we have asked you many questions today and we appreciate this. Sorry. As I wrap up this conversation I have a few more final questions would you be interested in a self service version of the survey for your members. Okay, this would show what members prioritize and any effective processes or practices they want to share, it's just a yes or no, no, no. Would there be anyone else in your brigade who would like to participate in helping us document your brigades effective processes and practices, if yes do you want to provide their info now. I don't think so. Okay. Is there anything else we should know or have asked him to interview. Um, I mean he again this all sounds like it's very based on a document. Yeah. Um, so, I think that document. Cannot Exist like on its own and like change the world. And, and I also to me a larger part of this is what's our purpose is a brigade network like at that stuff that we were kind of having discussions about and I think especially Code for America now has new leadership. I think that I think that's something that needs to be clear, a playbook is helpful but what is the playbook for, like, what's our over the same as individual events what is, what are we trying to do, and I don't I'm not very clear on that. I think that's something that needs to be done you can you can do a playbook and like go through the motions and continue to have like hacknight to make difference but I think the piece of like building the movement, still lacks clarity to me. Right. I'll publickey while your answers to be okay and I'm gonna send you\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:27:19  \n",
      "the list. Maybe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:27:23  \n",
      "And you can pick not public at all, or delete your answers this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:27:33  \n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:27:35  \n",
      "if it's if it's my answers. It will be, I think it will be a parent who said it so fully public is fine. My question is like where is it fully public. Like I don't, I wouldn't be like super fond of like, it turns up in a Google search of my name, so my that would be my. I mean, I don't know you wouldn't really care but like that would be my question is like what what is what is public mean like where is public innocence so I'm gonna I'm fine with being like, because I think even without. I mean I guess people who don't know me, could maybe not figure out that these are my responses, but in that case, it doesn't matter anyways. Yeah, so basically you don't want this attached to your name and a Google search but other than that you don't really care. Who knows what yeah it just depends on where like it yeah if it's like, Yeah, I don't know, like if it's like 10 paid, like that's fine. I think it's where it's public it's just,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unknown Speaker  1:28:35  \n",
      "I don't know, but I'm,\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire Salinas  1:28:36  \n",
      "I'm fine with my name being attached to these responses. All right. Um, okay, so thank you for taking time to talk with me today we'll spend, they will send you sorry a follow up email with helpful links including how to pass on the interview opportunity to other leaders, and the current version of the boss, you will also be receiving a copy of your responses. Again thank you and have a nice rest of your week okay and then the other part is like I did not get to write every single word you said although I got a lot of it and summarized A lot of it. Oh, and so there was like another reporting piece where they got like a pretty much a transcript of what we said, so I'm sure they'll look at that but just so you know I need to check out this website. Honor. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, it came on and it said that I was you know already like live. Oh, so weird. It's just they're written. Yeah, everything we said today is written, which, again, I don't know that they would go back and like you can see it typing as adult, um, and Trent and like pull everything out of it. I'm like I don't know that they would have time for that but it's all there, and yet. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, um, and all your ideas were super interesting I learned a lot I enjoyed talking to you. Um, yeah, good luck with everything with getting people to step up and take your years. I mean I obviously I care a lot about this organization the work they do. Just for four years I kind of need a break, but I think that there are some really, I think that the meaningful work can really continue but there's some big things that need to be done in the interim. Yeah, absolutely. Hey, if it's not, if you're open to it I would love to add you on a LinkedIn. Sure. I need to like get back to LinkedIn and. Oh, you don't really use too much. Okay, and I need to.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah,\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah, yeah I'm just honored a lot looking for UX opportunities. Cool. Well, great to talk to you. Hope you have a great rest of your day off. Good, um, let me know. I know a few people here locally and I would definitely am glad that you connected with Code for America, there are some really great UX people in different brigades you should check out the new orleans when. And when they have meetups, but especially these other ones if you, if you have a chance to look. They had like some of the groups, I mean essentially you could probably still participate remotely projects like I know in Florida, the one person Florida was really involved with something like, Yeah, I would, I would just say to like, just check out and you can say that you know this is kind of an entry point. But that's that would that would definitely be\n",

      "your, you found me on LinkedIn. If I have a chance I remember I connected with someone from Austin. Yeah, in DC, and she does UX stuff, or a company that contracts with the federal government related to health care, totally cool. Yeah, yeah, I appreciate all the connections, um, and like you said I can do stuff remotely right now because everyone's doing that anyway. Um, but yeah I mean, even if it's like a volunteer project for a little while, or maybe someone in the industry who has like a connection, definitely open. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this I think it is a great group for networking in that way. So, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cool, well I'll check it out. Awesome. All right, it was great talking with you. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Like I said, I learned a lot so. Alright. Have a good rest of your day. Okay, you too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.\n",
